## Brief

Build a full-stack MERN web application and deploy to Heroku. Use an Express API to serve data from a MongoDB database, consuming the data on a front end built with React. Combine this with a public API to supplement the data presented on the front end. Implement thoughtful wireframes/user stories to establish core MVP. Deliver a visually impressive design. Automate testing on at least one RESTful resource on the back end. Code collaboratively using source control (GitHub) to resolve any conflicts.


## Approach

After researching a number of public APIs, we delved deeper into https://ridb.recreation.gov/, an American government website listing "rec areas"—i.e. points of interest such as national parks—and "facilities", which encompassed campgrounds. The API was easy to navigate and utilise. We decided to build a camping app which would enable people to discover rec areas in any US state and find campgrounds and hotels nearby.

## Technologies Used
- HTML; CSS/Sass; JavaScript; React
- Node.js, inc. `fs` module; Mongoose; Express; Cloudinary
- Axios; bcrypt; Json Web Token; Mapbox
- React Hook Form; React Tabs; Yup; Mocha
- Chai; FontAwesome

## Wireframe

To aid our front-end logic and distribution of responsibilities, we constructed a wireframe that detailed the user journey.
