The ocean played an important part of the Bokeya life. Fish , shellfish, sea mammals, and seaweed were gathered from the ocean and coast for food. From the land, vegetables, berries, roots and greens were gathered and mammals and birds hunted. The Bokeya traded items from the coast for acorns, buckeye, and pine nuts found further inland. <p>\r\nDuring the late 1800s, the town of Flumeville or Rollerville was located roughly at the intersection of Lighthouse Rd. and Highway 1. This small settlement helped move timber from the interior forests via the Garcia River with a system of flumes (trough-like channels filled with water), a narrow gauge railroad, and chute to sailing ships at Point Arena Harbor. <p>\r\nCattle troughs, a milk barn, and road system from the early 1900s remain as evidence of dairy operations. Joseph Sheppard established a Jersey dairy farm on portions of this area in the late 1800s. Around 1924, A.O. Stornetta purchased the ranch from the widow of Joseph Sheppard. Stornetta was known for combining local dairy operations. <p>\r\n<b>Point Arena Lighthouse Tower—1870</b><p>\r\nThe original lighthouse tower in the year it was opened. Constructed of brick and mortar in 1869, the tower housed a First Order Fresnel Lens. The tower was 100 feet tall. The great earthquake of 1906 damaged the lighthouse beyond repair and destroyed the lens. It is speculated that the spiral staircase prevented the tower from collapsing. The original staircase is still in use today inside the second tower. <p>\r\n<h2>Wildlife</h2> <a data-flickr-embed=\"true\"  href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/blmcalifornia/28551506780/in/photolist-kUXiYL-qeLEyd-bcfwrx-qwatev-kUVEAx-eocNCi-ep91G3-ep91W1-bcfnCx-bcf9Hc-bcf9Hr-bcf9Hn-bcfnCZ-bcfnD2-28qyb1K-Rzsq6o-QSyxzQ-QSyptu-QV4r3a-QSykCJ-RY7dDi-RY7bw2-QV4jek-RzrXxo-QV4eP8-QV46xi-S6tFkW-RzrD3Y-Sa3z5z-QSxGkh-RzruHG-KTkRZN-KW6DYn-KW6C8D-KuZWfh-KuZUym-RzryDN-JZLQ1X-KTkRj9-KW6yte-KuZREq-KW6vvF-KuZPdS-KuZMMq-KuZKNf-KuZEs5-KuZCBS-KuZC1S-JZLxNg-JZL5Ne\" title=\"Point Arena-Stornetta unit of the California Coastal National Monument\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/28551506780_8826eaf002_n.jpg\" width=\"245\" height=\"320\" align=\"right\" alt=\"Point Arena-Stornetta unit of the California Coastal National Monument\"></a><InvalidTag async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The Unit is home to nine special status species, including plants, mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and insects.

The forest is approximately 517,000 acres and includes land in Elk, Forest, McKean and Warren counties in the northwestern corner of the state. The U.S. Forest Service brought new concepts in forest management to the Allegheny Plateau -- multiple benefits and sustainability. The motto \"Land of Many Uses\" captures the National Forest goal of a healthy, vigorous forest that provides wood products, watershed protection, a variety of wildlife habitats and recreational opportunities -- not only for us today, but in a sustainable way so future generations can enjoy these benefits, too.\nNo matter the season the Allegheny has your destination! Paddle down the Allegheny or Clarion Rivers, hike the North Country National Scenic Trail or ride on the miles of OHV and motorcycle trail. Looking for less human interaction?

During the Pleistocene Epoch, this area and most of northwestern Nevada, was covered by ancient Lake Lahontan. Over the last 10,000 years, the level of ancient Lake Lahontan fluctuated widely, at times drying up completely. When above water, the Grimes Point area would have been marshland with a wide variety of wetland plants and animals available for use by prehistoric populations. Grimes Point was first visited by Native Americans perhaps 8,000 years ago or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grimes Point is a field of basalt boulders that are covered with a glossy black patina, commonly called desert varnish. Many of the boulders are covered with pecked or carved rock art called petroglyphs. The antiquity of many of the petroglyphs can be evidenced by how varnish has completely repatinated the carved surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n</p>Visitors today can view examples of petroglyphs along a 1/4 mile, self-guided interpretive trail. The trail was originally constructed by the Youth Conservation Corps and named Nevada's first National Recreation Trail in 1978.  Handicapped accessible restrooms and picnic facilities are available at this popular stop on U.S. Highway 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact the BLM Carson City District Office at (775) 885-6000 for more information or to arrange for a guided tour of the site for school or other large groups. Guided public tours are also available at nearby Hidden Cave on the second and fourth Saturday of each month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the Churchill County Museum in Fallon and the Nevada State Museum in Carson City for additional displays about prehistoric Nevada and Grimes Point and Hidden Cave. Please stay on the trail and help ensure this special place remains for future generations by respectfully viewing the petroglyphs. Take nothing but photographs. Please do not touch, chalk, create rubbings of the petroglyphs, or damage them in any way. <p>Hidden Cave is an archaeological site which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1972, as part of Grimes Point. The cave itself was formed around 21,000 years ago by the waves of rising Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. In the mid-1920's, the cave was found by four school boys, the first 20th century humans to do so. The cave has been excavated by archaeologists three times: once in 1940, again in 1951, and finally a large excavation in 1979-1980 by the American Museum of Natural History. A high proportion of the artifacts found in Hidden Cave were unbroken and arranged in concentrations. That led to the conclusion that 3,500 to 3,800 years ago people used the cave more as a cache (a place to store objects for later) than for habitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BLM gives free public tours of Hidden Cave on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month with the exception of any three day weekend where the Friday or Monday is a federally recognized holiday, like Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, and Labor Day. The tours begin at the Churchill County Museum in Fallon, at 9:30 a.m. with a special video showing, and then the group caravans out to Hidden Cave and walks up the trail to the cave entrance. The tours end by 12:00 p.m. Additionally, tours for private groups can be arranged to be given at other times by docents from the Churchill County Museum. If you plan to visit Hidden Cave, please wear sturdy walking shoes, bring water, and dress appropriately for the weather (it can change in a hurry during every season).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidden Cave can only be accessed through taking a scheduled tour. The site is on a 1/2 mile interpretive loop trail that is not handicapped accessible. The tour may not be suitable for very young children because of its length and the climb up the hill.</p>","RecAreaPhone":"702-885-6000","RecAreaEmail":"ccfoweb@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-118.637173,"RecAreaLatitude":39.404064,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Grimes Point Rest Area","address2":"US Highway 50","city":"Fallon","state":"NV","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"12","RecAreaName":"Folsom S.

The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The Refuge is a direct result of Dr. Carr bringing attention to the world's declining turtle populations due to over-exploitation and loss of safe habitat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. This represents 25-35% of all loggerhead and green sea turtle nests in the US. It also serves as a minor nesting area for the leatherback turtle, which is one of the world's largest and rarest sea turtles. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 248-acre refuge is also unique for its placement within a patchwork of protected lands and among properties that have already been developed. To help preserve this globally important nesting ground the Service has established a partnership with State and County governments and private conservation groups to acquire and manage this dune habitat. The primary management thrust is to provide long term protection of this habitat for sea turtles and other listed species as well as providing compatible public use. Collaboratively, this partnership, known as the Archie Carr Working Group has protected over 900 acres and continues to educate thousands of residents and visitors about the unique characteristics of the barrier island ecosystem.","RecAreaPhone":"772-562-3909","RecAreaEmail":"archiecarr@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-80.4554,"RecAreaLatitude":27.8752,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"4055 Wildlife Way ","address2":"","city":"Vero Beach","state":"FL","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"12730","RecAreaName":"National Aviation Heritage Area","RecAreaDescription":"Aviation is chock-full of tradition & history and nowhere will you find a richer collection of aviation than here, the birthplace of aviation.

Miles of boreal forest surround a unique geological feature -- the Nogahabara Sand Dunes. The roughly circular active dune field spans about 6 miles in diameter, and was formed thousands of years ago when wind-blown glacial sand was deposited at the base of the Nulato Hills. The isolated dunes are lightly vegetated, and continue to shift with the wind. \r\n\r\n<p>The Three-Day Slough area also lies within the Koyukuk Wilderness and receives some public use, primarily by moose-hunters in the fall.

Because of natural events, the river shifted east forming a biologically rich swampland comprised of bottomland hardwoods intermixed with cypress and tupelo. The former channel basin attracted Native Americans who utilized the bountiful natural resources. By the late 1800’s, settlers and loggers started draining the swamp while removing large tracts of old-growth forest. In 1944, Congress authorized the purchase of the remnant forest lands to create the 21,592 acre Mingo National Wildlife Refuge. Today, Mingo Wilderness is a large fragment of this refuge. The wilderness provides critical food and shelter for bald eagles and migratory waterfowl along the Mississippi Flyway.

There is a special feeling of wildness about this place, Tamarac, best expressed by the eerie howl of a wolf, mournful wail of a loon, or the drumming of a ruffed grouse from deep within the forest. \r\n<p>Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge is located in the glacial lake country of northwestern Minnesota. It was established in 1938 as a refuge breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Tamarac is a land of rolling forested hills interspersed with lakes, rivers, marshes, bogs and shrub swamps. The token of the refuge is the Tamarack tree. This unusual tree is a deciduous conifer, turning brilliant gold before losing its needles each fall. Tamarac’s wilderness consists of four sections of the 42,738- acre refuge: three islands in Tamarac Lake (totaling 65 acres in the southwest section) and the 2000 acre northwest corner. Here you will find stands of mature white pines, a favorite nesting tree of bald eagles. \r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the refuge was a prized hunting, fishing, ricing and maple sugaring area for Native American tribes. The Sioux once controlled the area followed by the Ojibwe. Today the northern half of the refuge lies within the original White Earth Indian Reservation established in 1867. Tribal members continue to hunt, fish, trap and harvest herbs, berries and wild rice on the refuge. \r\n\r\n<p>Tamarac lies in the heart of one of the most diverse transition zones in North America, where northern hardwood, coniferous forests and the tall grass prairie converge. This diversity of habitat brings with it a wealth of wildlife. There are over 250 species of birds and 50 species of mammals. Spring on the refuge attracts a magnificent warbler migration and fall is highlighted with an abundance of waterfowl including more than 15,000 ring-necked ducks at its peak. Bald eagles are common and wolves are occasionally seen. Tamarac is one of the premier production areas for trumpeter swans in the lower 48 states. The refuge also provides critical nesting habitat for golden-winged warblers, a Species of Concern whose population has declined steadily over the past 35 years due to loss of habitat. Other wildlife include black bear, porcupine, mink, fisher, otter and beaver. \r\n\r\n<p>The northwest wilderness area is part of the sanctuary which is open September-February.The wilderness does not have established hiking trails and overnight camping is prohibited. \r\n\r\n<p>With the brilliant fall colors of aspen, maple, oak, birch and tamarack interspersed with evergreens, Autumn truly is a beautiful time to experience the wilderness of Tamarac.","RecAreaPhone":"218-847-2641","RecAreaEmail":"tamarac@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&latitude=47.0682&longitude=-95.598741&zoom=13","RecAreaLongitude":-95.654751,"RecAreaLatitude":46.957924,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"35704 County Hwy 26","address2":"","city":"Rochert","state":"MN","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"12838","RecAreaName":"Togiak Wilderness","RecAreaDescription":"<p><br>The Togiak Wilderness now contains a total of 2,274,066 acres and is managed by the Fish & Wildlife Service's a, href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/togiak/\">Togiak National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

Eagles came back to nest on the refuge in 1989 and have annually raised young since 1993.  Also, since most of the bottomland hardwood forests have disappeared, it has become more important to preserve and restore this habitat for the wide variety of wildlife it supports.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a free-flowing river system, Big Lake NWR was changed to a lake / swamp ecosystem by the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811-12.  \r\n\r\nBig Lake today consists primarily of wooded swamps and open water.

These past river conditions created a haven for wildlife, which included vast floodplain forests of giant trees, marshes, and even wet prairies.  Today's river is channelized.  It is deeper and faster, and controlled by levees, dikes, and other containment structures.

The beautiful natural lake is studded with picturesque cypress and tupelo trees, and surrounded by swamps that graduate into bottomland hardwoods and then into upland mixed pine/hardwoods.  The refuge supports an excellent fisheries resource and provides valuable habitat for migratory waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, and many resident wildlife species. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This semi-urban refuge is ideally located to provide a place for people to connect with the natural world.

Since that time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been acquiring bottomland hardwood habitat in the Pearl River Basin. On December 13, 1989, Congress authorized a boundary expansion for Bogue Chitto NWR that included an additional 8,400 acres of bottomland hardwoods in St. Tammany Parish. To date, some 36,447 acres have been placed under refuge management. The refuge is still in an acquisition phase.\r\n\r\n<p>White-tail deer, squirrel, turkey and hog hunting and fishing is offered to the public. The endangered and threatended species found on the refuge are bald eagle, ringed-sawback turtle, gopher tortoise, inflated heelsplitter mussel, and gulf sturgeon.  Access is primarily by boat on the refuge's Louisiana side and road access is available on the refuge's Mississippi side.  In Summer 2002, a new walking trail was unveiled on the Louisiana side of the Refuge.  This 3/4 of a mile walking trail offers a unique journey into the interior of Bogue Chitto's majestic habitat.  \r\n\r\n<p>Bogue Chitto NWR is primarily composed of bottomland hardwood habitat interlaced by the Bogue Chitto and Pearl River Systems.  Numerous sloughs, bayous and lakes are located on the refuge.  Water levels fluctuate by several feet from their low point in the summer to winter/spring flood stage.  Over 90% of the refuge can be flooded during seasonal high river periods.  The mixed hardwood forest includes water oak, overcup oak, American elm, sweetgum, and swamp red maple on higher elevations and bald cypress, tupelo gum, and swamp blackgum along the wettest areas.  Mid-story in mixed hardwoods includes ironwood, arrowwood, Virginia willow and reproduction of the overstory.

In 1972, the Fish and Wildlife Service reconstructed the dam to maintain the integrity of the structure and to assure continued maintenance of the open water, marsh, and wetland areas created by the original dam.  A natural overflow near the structure provides an additional escape route for high water thereby affording extra protection for the dam and control structures.  A right-of-way provides access to the dam for maintenance and public use.\r\n<p>Carlton Pond is one of the few areas in the state which provides nesting habitat for black terns, which are on the endangered species list maintained by the State of Maine.  State and federal non-game biologists and researchers have been monitoring black tern use of Carlton Pond WPA and other areas for several years in an attempt to better determine the species' population status.\r\n<p>Carlton Pond WPA has historically provided good nesting habitat for waterfowl and other birds.

Due to its location, the refuge is home to a variety of plants, animals, and habitat types characteristic of both the coastal plain and Piedmont Plateau. Rolling sandhills and deep sandy soils found here are remnants of an ancient coastal shoreline of what is now known as the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge supports approximately 190 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 41 species of reptiles, 25 species of amphibians, and innumerable species of plants.  Among this diverse group of fauna and flora are several species that are listed as threatened or endangered.  These include the Swainson's warbler, red-cockaded woodpecker, pine barrens treefrog, white wicky, Well's pixie moss, and the sweet pitcher plant.  Thirty man-made lakes & ponds & over 1,200 acres of fallow fields, forest openings, & cultivated fields contribute to the diverse habitat found here.

The refuge contains 25,162 acres divided into two units.  The 6,671 acre Headquarters Unit borders nine miles of the northeast shore of Catahoula Lake, a 26,000 acre natural wetland renowned for its large concentrations of migratory waterfowl.  The 18,491 acre Bushley Bayou Unit, located 8 miles west of Jonesville, was established May 16, 2001.  This acquisition was made possible through a partnership agreement between The Conservation Fund, American Electric Power, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.  The habitat found at the refuge is primarily lowland hardwood forest subject to seasonal backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers.\r\n<p>White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge.  Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat.  Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation.  In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area.  Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site):  a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey Wills Wildlife Management Area.

The Amargosa Unit's (the northern unit) most striking feature is Amargosa Canyon, which contains a perennial stream. This perennial surface flow supports wetland habitats offering food, cover, and nesting opportunities for a wide variety of bird life. Those habitats also sustain fish, mammals, insects, and mollusks having low population numbers and/or very limited distributions. \n\n<p> \n\nThe Kingston Unit (center unit) covers seventeen miles of continuous ridgeline above 6,000 feet known as the Kingston Range. Elevations reach 7,323 at the top of Kingston Peak.  \n\n<p> \n\nThe Shadow Mountain Unit (southern unit) covers much of the Shadow Mountains, a large series of low-lying rounded peaks with gently meandering interior canyons and numerous erosion channels.  \n\n<p> \n\nThe wilderness is botanically one of the most diverse areas within the California Desert. Botanists have identified 505 native plant species and 32 are viewed as endangered, rare, or limited in distribution. Cresote bush scrub vegetation is found at lower elevations and juniper-pinyon woodland at higher elevations. The only stand of giant Nolina in the eastern Mojave Desert is found in Kingston Range, and a relic stand of white fir trees clings (one of only three stands found in the California Desert) to the slopes of two drainages just below Kingston Peak. Also located in the wilderness is a portion of the Shadow Valley-Cima Dome Joshua tree forest (one of the densest concentrations in the world).  \n\n<p> \n\nThe vegetation and perennial water support a variety of wildlife species which do not occur in nearby drier habitats. Bird densities are many times higher and contain higher species diversity. The Kingston Mountains are one of the four localities in California in which confirmed sightings of the banded gila monster have been made.  \n\n<p> \n\nOther wildlife species include bighorn sheep, wild burros, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbits, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, roadrunners, quail, rattlesnakes, tarantulas, and several species of lizards. The southeastern portion of the wilderness provides critical habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.  \n\n<p> \n\nThe wilderness area is an ecological transition zone between the Great Basin and Mojave Desert with numerous species of flora and fauna reaching their northern and southern most distribution limits. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<p> \n\nFor more information about this wilderness, please visit <a href=\"https://wilderness.net\">Wilderness Connect</a>. \n\n<p>  \n\n<h2> Leave No Trace </h2><p>  \n\nHow to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains).

All of this wilderness is located in Oregon and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).</p>\r\n<p>The Oregon Badlands Wilderness holds a number of remarkable and exciting landforms and geologic features. Most of the area includes the rugged Badlands volcano, which has features of inflated lava. Windblown volcanic ash and eroded lava make up the sandy, light-colored soil that covers the low and flat places in these fields of lava. Dry River, active during each of several ice ages, marks the southeast boundary between two volcanic areas—Badlands volcano and the Horse Ridge volcanoes. Earth movements along the Brothers Fault Zone have faulted and sliced up the old Horse Ridge volcanoes, but not Badlands volcano. The Badlands formed in an unusual way. The flow that supplied lava to the Badlands apparently developed a hole in the roof of its main lava tube. This hole became the source of lava that built a shield volcano that we call the Badlands (technically, a rootless shield volcano). An irregularly-shaped pit crater at the top of the shield marks the site where lava flowed in all directions to create the Badlands.</p>\r\n<p>A variety of wildlife species inhabit the area including yellow-bellied marmots, bobcat, mule deer, elk, and antelope. The southern portion of the Badlands Wilderness includes crucial winter range for mule deer. Avian species include prairie falcons and golden eagles.</p>\r\n<p>You can also explore cracked volcanic pressure ridges, called tumuli, or walk narrow moat-like cracks in the ground. Traces of human history are visible to the careful observer. At 29,000 acres, the Oregon Badlands Wilderness represents an outstanding example of ancient western juniper woodlands atop Columbia River Basalts. Almost 50 miles of trails offer the visitor many opportunities for hiking or horseback riding loops of various lengths.</p>\r\n<p>As a designated wilderness, the Oregon Badlands Wilderness enjoys the highest level of permanent protection!</p><b>Leave No Trace principles:</b><ol><li>Plan Ahead and Prepare</li><li>Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces</li><li>Dispose of Waste Properly</li><li>Leave What You Find</li><li>Minimize Campfire Impacts</li><li>Respect Wildlife</li><li>Be Considerate of Other Visitors</li></ol><p><b>Regulations:</b><br>Motorized equipment and equipment used for mechanical transport are generally prohibited on all federal lands designated as wilderness.

Most of the remainder of the refuge acreage is woodlands dominated by pitch pines, oaks, and white cedar, with some fields which are maintained to provide habitat diversity.  More than 6,000 acres are designated as Wilderness Area. This includes Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier\r\n\r\nbeaches in New Jersey. These pristine sites provide critical nesting habitat for threatened piping plovers and a wide variety of other beachnesting species. Beaches and dunes provide nesting habitat for piping plovers, black skimmers and least terns. Occasionally peregrine falcons, bald eagles and osprey are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach spring and fall, thousands of water birds stop at Forsythe Refuge during their long migrations.  Waterfowl, wading birds, and shore birds may be viewed from the Wildlife Drive as they feed and rest.  Refuge uplands also provide important stopover habitat for migrating passerines.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForsythe is a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site, a Wetlands of International Importance site under the Ramsar Convention, and an important birding area. It also is a part of The Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve and The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. In 2002 the refuge was the recipient of the New Jersey Governor's Eco-Tourism Award.","RecAreaPhone":"609-652-1665","RecAreaEmail":"forsythe@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-74.450623,"RecAreaLatitude":39.46386,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Great Creek Road","address2":"","city":"Oceanville","state":"NJ","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1387","RecAreaName":"Egmont Key National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"The Egmont Key National Wildlife Refuge, was established in 1974 and protects a diverse community of animals and plants, many of which are either threatened or endangered.

Together, the State and the Service have been able to develop large complexes of habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife species. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Wetland Management District encompasses 35 counties, at this date, there are WPAs in 16\r\n\r\ncounties. Most acquisitions are intended to increase habitat at existing wetland complexes, so it is unlikely that tracts\r\n\r\nwill be acquired in the entire 35-county area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost WPAs are small, from 100 to 500 acres, but several have\r\n\r\ngrown considerably. Union Hills WPA in Cerro Gordo County is the largest in Iowa at over 2,000 acres.\r\n\r\nSpring Run, a large complex of State and Federal lands in Dickinson County, is the second largest WPA.\r\n\r\nDugout Creek WPA in Dickinson County and Lower Morse Lake in Wright County are also among the larger\r\n\r\nrestored tracts in the Iowa Wetland Management District.","RecAreaPhone":"515-928-2523 ","RecAreaEmail":"unionslough@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-94.110516,"RecAreaLatitude":43.283732,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"1710 360th St.","address2":"","city":"Titonka","state":"IA","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1437","RecAreaName":"Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge lies midway between Buffalo and Rochester, NY, within the Atlantic Flyway.

The mainland refuge unit, the Hunting Islands, and Price Island are in Washington. Tenasillahe Island, Wallace Island, and several parcels around Westport are in Oregon.The valuable habitat the refuge preserves for the deer also benefits a large variety of wintering birds, a small herd of Roosevelt elk, river otter, various reptiles and amphibians including painted turtles and red-legged frogs, and several pairs of nesting bald eagles and osprey.    The Columbian white-tailed deer is one of 30 subspecies of white-tailed deer in North America, and the only one found west of the Cascade Mountains. These deer once ranged throughout the river valleys west of the Cascade Mountains from the Umpqua River in Oregon, northward through the Willamette Valley to Puget Sound, and westward down the lower Columbia River.During the 1800s, deer numbers were dangerously low due to overhunting and loss of habitat. By the turn of the century, they had disappeared from nearly all of their range and, in the 1930s, were thought to be extinct. Remnant populations were discovered here and near Roseburg, Oregon.In 1968, the lower Columbia River population was listed as a federally endangered species because it was in imminent danger of becoming extinct. This population is now found only along the lower Columbia River between Skamokawa, Washington, and Clatskanie, Oregon.Today, about 300 of these deer live on the refuge. Another 300-400 live on private lands along the river. The areas upstream from the refuge on Puget Island and on the Oregon side of the river are vital to reestablishing and maintaining viable populations of the species.

It sits atop the Arctic Circle, with approximately a third of the refuge above that meridian and two-thirds below. The refuge is a prime example of Alaska's boreal ecosystem, which is dominated by black and white spruce with some white birch and poplars. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region's typically short, hot summers give rise to numerous thunderstorms and lightning strikes. This results in a continuous cycle of burn and recovery.  Natural wildfires create diverse habitats with different plant species, and levels of maturity within each species.  The resulting mosaic of habitat types supports a variety of wildlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge's migratory fish, chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as sheefish, are creatures of extremes. Its Sheefish make the longest spawning journey of any of their species' population on record, while Kanuti's salmon travel more than 1000 miles up the Yukon before entering the Koyukuk River system to spawn. Refuge waters support twelve other fish species, including arctic grayling and northern pike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtecting breeding habitat for migratory birds is central to the mission of Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Nearly 130 species of birds spend part or all of the year on refuge lands. With the loss of wetlands in regions outside of Alaska, the importance of Kanuti as a nesting area for birds is likely to increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge's boreal forest is home to 37 species of mammals, including brown and black bears, several wolf packs, moose, wolverine, beavers, muskrats, marten and mink.

The refuge is adjacent to Kealia Beach, which is a nesting ground for the endangered hawksbill turtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKealia Pond serves as a settling basin a 56-square mile watershed that results in seasonal intermittent flooding during winter months and dryer conditions during late summer months. This creates open water (200 acres) and shallow mud flat areas interspersed with vegetation, which provide suitable resting, feeding, and nesting habitat for endangered water birds.

On the south of the wash are the dunes.  These dunes, while not the largest in Utah, are unique in that they have many Cottonwood trees growing directly out of the dunes.

As the sedimentary rocks tilted, the more easily erodible rocks were removed by the action of water, creating the canyon as it is seen today.  <br><br>\r\nThe long, grass-covered slopes on the west side of the canyon are part of the Permian Phosphoria formation, a marine deposit composed of limestone, sandstone, dolomite, siltstone, bedded chert and phosphorite. The less-resistant rocks above the chert were eroded.  <br><br>\r\nThe bottom of the canyon and the lower 300 feet of the east side are eroded into the Triassic Chugwater formation. This consists of brick red sandstone, shale, and siltstone, and being less resistant to erosion, was removed from the underlying Phosphoria chert. The bright red color of the Chugwater is due to a great amount of oxidized iron between and on the grains of the rock. It is this coloration that gives Red Canyon its name. \r\n<br><br> \r\nRed Canyon Rim, which forms the east side of the valley, is comprised of salmon-colored Jurassic Nugget sandstone.

Lush vegetation blankets the mountains ranging from sedges, alders, and spruce to colorful wildflowers and berries.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1.9 million-acre Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge roughly encompasses the southwestern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, Uganik Island, the Red Peaks area on northwestern Afognak Island, and all of Ban Island.  No place on the refuge is more than 15 miles from the Pacific Ocean.  Without roads, the refuge provides a wilderness setting for fish, wildlife, and humans alike.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge is home to an estimated 2,300 brown bears, and at least 600 nesting pairs of bald eagles. More than 250 species of birds live upon or visit the refuge, while more than 1.5 million seabirds overwinter in nearshore waters surrounding Kodiak Island. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge also provides spawning and rearing habitat for all five North American species of Pacific salmon. Salmon produced on the refuge make up approximately 65% of the total commercial harvest in the Kodiak Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKodiak refuge offers superb recreational opportunities.

Northern pike, especially those that winter in the shallow lakes of the Northern Innoko National Wildlife Refuge, sometimes grow to record size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Koyukuk's wetlands, breeding waterfowl feast upon water plants and abundant protein-rich invertebrates. Young birds grow quickly in the short, lush summer, and prepare for the fall migration. As many as 100,000 ducks are hatched and raised on Refuge lands during a single nesting season. Migratory songbirds and raptors also depend on the rich resources of the Koyukuk Refuge for breeding and raising young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKoyukuk Refuge's Three-Day Slough area, part of the 400,000 acre Koyukuk Wilderness, has some of the most productive moose habitat in Alaska. This region has, at times, supported more than 10 moose per square mile.  Recent counts indicate that some areas still contain densities of five moose or more per square mile. As with much of the refuge big game work, these moose counts are cooperative efforts between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Alaska Department of Fish and Game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaribou from the migratory Western Arctic Herd, which numbers more than 450,000, often move into the northernmost reaches of the Refuge in winter months in search of lichens that lie beneath the snow.

Robert Stuart’s discovery of South Pass in October 1812 gave hope that a practical overland route to the Pacific (the route Lewis and Clark searched for but failed to find) did exist. <br><br> By 1824, South Pass was in annual use by mountain men and trappers engaged in the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade. Soon trappers discovered connections that linked South Pass with the Snake and Columbia rivers and with the Hudson’s Bay Company holdings of the Pacific Northwest. <br> <br> Some 150,000 pioneers went west between the years of 1849 and 1852. By the mid-1850s, stage coaches and freight wagons were regular users of the California, Mormon Pioneer and Oregon trails, rolling both east and west through South Pass. For 19 months in 1860-61, the riders of the Pony Express transcontinental mail service thundered through the pass on an incredible schedule covering 2,000 miles from St. Joseph, Missouri, to San Francisco, California, in 10 days or less. <br><br> Historians estimate that some 500,000 pioneers “went westering” along the South Pass trail system before the great overland wagon train migrations slowed down with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. About 80,000 were headed for the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Some 70,000 Mormons had the Great Salt Lake region as their destination. Most of the remaining 350,000 were bound for California with just a few headed for intermediate destinations. Of those that started the journey, one in 10 would not complete it. Thousands would die along the way, mostly from accidents, cholera and other diseases. Some would simply get to their destination and turn back.

Several waterfowl production areas are also managed as part of the Refuge complex. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting and fishing opportunities abound on Charles M. Russell NWR, its satellite refuges, and the waterfowl production areas. Boating is popular on the Missouri River and Fort Peck Reservoir. Several state parks and recreational areas have been developed within the Refuge. Each fall, hundreds of elk congregate in the Slippery Ann Wildlife Viewing Area, creating a spectacle not to be missed. Camping is permitted anywhere on the Refuge. The entire Refuge is open to hiking and horseback riding although no formal trails exist.

This refuge is one of the most biologically productive refuges within the Pacific Flyway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately 80 percent of the flyway's migrating waterfowl pass through the Klamath Basin on both spring and fall migrations, with 50 percent using the refuge. Peak waterfowl populations can reach 1.8 million birds, which represent 15 to 45 percent of the total birds wintering in California. The refuge produces between 30,000 and 60,000 waterfowl annually. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refuge is also a fall staging area for 20 to 30 percent of the central valley population of sandhill crane. From 20,000 to 100,000 shorebirds use refuge wetlands during the spring migration. Wintering wildlife populations include 500 bald eagle and 30,000 tundra swan. Spring and summer nesting wildlife include many colonial water birds, such as white-faced ibis, heron, egret, cormorant, grebe, white pelican, and gulls. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all, the refuge provides habitat for 25 species of special concern listed as threatened or sensitive by California and Oregon. All refuge waters are delivered through a system of diversion or irrigation canals associated with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Project.

By 1869, more than a quarter of a million people crossed the plains and mountains heading to the West to find gold and claim free land.\n \nThe California Trail offered several paths to the West Coast and California. One of the primary routes ran through South Pass, Wyoming, which then led California-bound pioneers through southeast Idaho.  Another route led to Salt Lake City and then northward to Idaho to rejoin the main trail at the City of Rocks near Granite Pass.\n\nBy the 1860s, freight and mail companies, military expeditions, new settlements and trading stations, and thousands of travelers headed in all directions had transformed the California Trail into a road.  But, in 1869, the Union Pacific Railroad was connected with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Point in northern Utah, making it possible to travel across the nation by rail   ushering in a new era in transportation and heralding the end of long-distance travel by wagon through the West. \n\n","RecAreaPhone":"208-373-4000","RecAreaEmail":"BLM_ID_StateOffice@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.2447222,"RecAreaLatitude":42.55388889,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Idaho State Office","address2":"","city":"","state":"ID","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"14986","RecAreaName":"Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail","RecAreaDescription":"The Lewis and Clark Backcountry Byway and Adventure Road is a 36-mile loop drive through a beautiful and historic landscape following the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.

It stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, across Idaho to the Bear Paw National Historic Trail in Chinook, Montana.\r\n\r\nBefore and after Lewis and Clark, the Nez Perce homeland extended throughout central Idaho, northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Here, the Nez Perce hunted, fished, collected camas and biscuitroot, and raised their children passing on knowledge acquired over millennia.\r\n\r\nAs fur trappers, traders, settlers, soldiers, missionaries, and farmers moved into or through the area, the Nez Perce and their lands underwent some very big changes. Tensions increased between the Nez Perce and these new people.  Anxious to avoid conflict, the Nez Perce signed a treaty to create a large reservation encompassing their traditional homeland. After gold was discovered inside the reservation in 1863 and as miners and settlers moved in to the reservation, a new treaty reduced the original reservation by 90 percent.\r\n\r\nSome tribal leaders rejected the new treaty. In May of 1877, the U.S. government ordered the “non-treaty” Nez Perce to relocate to the new reservation by June 14. After violence erupted, Chief Joseph and other Nez Perce leaders, including Toohoolhoolzote, decided it would be better to flee to Canada than to relocate to the reduced reservation. In 1877, 750 Nez Perce—two-thirds of them women, children, the elderly and the sick and with 2,000 of their own horses—battled and eluded more than 2,000 U.S. Army soldiers and other pursuers over 1,100 miles.

The heat of the magma flashed the river water to steam, shattering the glass into tiny fragments that welded together as the hot ash settled to the ground.

It has a history spanning some 300 years, with several periods of boom and bust.  Originally named Hedges, the town was completely abandoned in 1905, victim to speculative over-expansion and increasing debt.  Renamed Tumco in 1910 -- after The United Mines Company -- another attempt to go after the gold proved just as costly.  By 1911, the diminishing prospects of the mines forced the miners and their families to return to Yuma, signaling the end of Hedges/Tumco as a community. Gold was first discovered by Spanish colonists as they moved northward from Sonora, Mexico.  According to legend, two young boys came into their camp one evening with their shirts filled with gold ore.  These muchachos cargados (loaded boys) were the namesake for the Cargo Muchacho Mountains, where the Tumco deposits occur.  Following the first discovery of gold, numerous small mines were operated by Mexican settlers for many years. In 1877, the Southern Pacific Railroad completed the Yuma to Los Angeles line of its transcontinental route.  With the presence of the mountains, a gold rush into the area began.  This initial rush to stake mining claims soon gave way to mining companies that moved into the area, purchased claims and developed the mines on a large scale.  A 12 mile wood pipeline pumped over 100,000 gallons of water from the Colorado River per day, and the railroad carried mine timbers from northern Arizona for use in the expansive underground workings. Ultimately, over 200,000 ounces of gold was taken from the mines in the area.  Tumco was a typical mining town of its day.  Historical accounts talk of rich eastern investors, unscrupulous charlatans and colorful characters in the raucous townsite and the mining boom ultimately leading to financial ruin. Although little can be seen of Tumco, during the boom time of the 1890's, it supported a population of at least 500 people and the 40 and 100 stamp mills of the mine produced $1,000 per day in gold.","RecAreaPhone":"760-337-4400","RecAreaEmail":"BLM_CA_Web_EC@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-114.8326111,"RecAreaLatitude":32.88098889,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Bureau of Land Management","address2":"El Centro Field Office","city":"El Centro","state":"CA","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1508","RecAreaName":"Johnston Atoll National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Johnston Atoll National Wildlife Refuge is located in the central Pacific Ocean, 717 nautical miles west-southwest of Honolulu.

The purpose of acquisition, under the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 was \"... for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources ...\" and \"... for the benefit of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in performing its activities and services.  Such acceptance may be subject to the terms of any restrictive or affirmative covenant, or condition of servitude  . . . \"  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was the source of funding for the purchase\n\n\n\nThe refuge protects the second-largest and most unique peatland in Maine.  It contains several raised bogs or domes, separated from each other by extensive areas of streamside meadows.  Sunkhaze Stream bisects the refuge along a northeast to southwest orientation and, with its six tributaries, creates a diversity of wetland communities.  The bog and stream wetlands, along with the adjacent uplands and associated transition zones, provide important habitat for many wildlife species.  The wetland complex consists primarily of wet meadows, shrub thickets, cedar swamps, extensive red and silver maple floodplain forests and open freshwater stream habitats, along with those plant communities associated with peatlands such as shrub heaths and cedar and spruce bogs.\n\n\n\nSunkhaze Meadows National Wildlife Refuge provides habitat for three plants, seven birds, two mollusks and three invertebrates listed as Endangered or Threatened by the State of Maine.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990's, the Benton and Sandy Stream Divisions were added to the refuge under the auspices of the 1990 Farm Bill.  These small areas are respectively located in the towns of Benton and Unity, Maine.  Both are managed for grassland-nesting birds, some of which are rare in Maine.\n\n\n\nFour conservation easements are also managed by Sunkhaze Meadows Refuge.  They are the Downing, Fortin, Miller, and Quayle Easements, totaling seven separate parcels of land.  Downing Easement lands are located in the towns of Corinth and Exeter.

An important \r\n\r\nsecondary purpose was to preserve a remnant flock of prairie chickens. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, adequate grassland habitat to maintain a \r\n\r\nviable population of the birds was not available. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince establishment of the refuge, the primary emphasis \r\n\r\non waterfowl species has been expanded to include the Eastern Prairie Population \r\n\r\nof Canada geese. Canada geese were first observed using the refuge in the early\r\n\r\n1940s, and numbers increased gradually to peak populations over 150,000 birds \r\n\r\nannually.

Originally, the White Rock Range WSA was 24,065 acres in size and straddled the border of Nevada and Utah. In 2004, the Nevada portion was designated as wilderness under the Lincoln County Conservation Recreation Development Act. Adjacent lands in Utah continue to be managed as a WSA by the Cedar City BLM Field Office. The WSA and surrounding lands consist of gentle mountain terrain with associated foothills and benches. Many side canyons and drainages exist throughout the range offer opportunities for exploration. Vegetation consists mostly of pinyon-juniper woodland and fir depending on elevation which ranges from approximately 6,200 to over 9,000 feet. Interspersed throughout the area are numerous small grassy meadows where springs support riparian vegetation. Notable wildlife found in the White Rock Range WSA include cougar, bobcat, badger, jackrabbit, along with several bird and reptile species, as well as a large elk herd and mule deer herd. The White Rock Range is primitive in the most literal sense. Virtually untouched by human activity, the area has the capacity to accommodate large numbers of visitors while still maintaining solitude due to the heavy tree cover and jumbled mountain topography. The volcanic nature of the geology results in strangely beautiful peaks that tower above a sea of green trees offering expansive views of surrounding basins and ranges.

A free permit is required and may be obtained by calling the BLM Moab Field Office at (435) 259-2100 between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday-Friday (excluding Federal Holidays).  Permits are emailed or faxed and trip leaders must sign and carry the permit on the river to be authorized.  Please contact the BLM Moab Office several days in advance of your trip or if you need to make changes before your launch date.  All boaters must read and adhere to all stipulations of the permit.</p><p> The primary challenge for running this river is the erratic and short (sometimes non-existent) boating season.  Flows generally peak between late April and early May.  Stream flow conditions can be found on the U.S. Geological Survey website.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Rapids on this section range from class I to class IV, and the most challenging rapid is near the Utah and Colorado stateline.  The \"Stateline Rapid\" is a mile-long rock garden and requires excellent scouting (from river right) and quick maneuvering at all water levels.  Mistakes in this rapid can result in a very long and dangerous swim.  Many groups choose to put in below this rapid.  <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/Moab_DoloresRiverMap.pdf\">A pdf map</a> is available at <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/Moab_DoloresRiverMap.pdf\">https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/Moab_DoloresRiverMap.pdf</a>.

Bring an adequate amount of drinking water as the Dolores and its tributaries are unfit for human consumption.  Land ownership along the Dolores River is mixed, please respect the rights of private landowners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the portion of the Dolores River that flows through Colorado, please contact the Tres Rios Field Office.

Updates will be posted to the BLM website, www.blm.gov/utah/alerts/operations. </p>Permits are required for all boating trips in Labyrinth Canyon. River recreation in Labyrinth Canyon is jointly managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands. These agencies have adopted one set of regulations for river recreation and have joint enforcement responsibility. The Moab Field Office is the official public contact point for Labyrinth Canyon information and permits.  <p/>\r\n<h2>How to Obtain a Permit </h2>\r\nPermits can be downloaded from this website and emailed to: blm_ut_labyrinth@blm.gov ( take a hard copy with you for the trip). The approved permit must be in the trip leader's possession while in Labyrinth Canyon and all permit stipulations must be followed. Contact the Moab BLM Field Office for further information: 435-259-2100.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Trip Information </h2><p/>\t\t\r\nA trip through Labyrinth Canyon on the lower Green River can be enjoyed almost any time of the year, except in winter when there may be ice on the river. It is an easy, flat-water stretch suitable for canoes, kayaks, and rafts of all types. The heaviest use is between Easter and Labor Day. Motorized craft occasionally use this portion of the river. Be aware that during low water motorboats must share the narrow channel.\r\n<p/>\r\nThe river level fluctuates throughout the summer. Peak runoff from mountain snowmelt generally occurs from the end of May to mid-June. The water flow gradually decreases to its low point in the fall and winter. July and August are the hottest months and afternoon thunderstorms are common during this period. </p>\r\nA minimum of three to four days should be allowed for the 68 river miles from Green River to Mineral Bottom. An alternative launch from Ruby Ranch results in a 45-mile trip (hours are sunrise to sunset, daily. Fees are $5.00 per person, $10.00 per boat). Much of the land between the city of Green River and Ruby Ranch, 23 miles downstream, is privately owned. Below Ruby Ranch, most of the land is state or federally managed.<p/>  \r\nCamping regulations are on the permit and Utah State boating and fishing regulations apply.</p>\r\nThe area is remote and services are non-existent. Your group must be self-contained and self-reliant to deal with emergencies. Cell phone service is not available within the canyons. Plan to carry all your drinking water. <p/>\r\nThe usual take-out is at Mineral Bottom. Access to Mineral Bottom is via Highway 313 north of Moab. A sign marks the turnoff to Mineral Bottom (approximately 14 miles up Hwy 313). The 17 miles of dirt road to the take-out are usually in good condition, but can be very slick and even impassible when wet. This road is best suited to vehicles with high ground clearance, especially the switchbacks and last mile to the take-out. <h2>Contact Information </h2>\r\n(435) 259-2100 <p/>\r\nRiver Office Hours: 7:45 am - 4:30 pm (MDT), Monday - Friday </p> \r\nEmail: blm_ut_labyrinth@blm.gov </p>\r\nLink to Labyrinth Canyon River Permit https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/Recreation_Utah_LabyrinthPermit_6-28-17.pdf","RecAreaPhone":"435-259-2100","RecAreaEmail":"blm_ut_mb_mail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/BLMUtahLabyrinthRimsMap.pdf","RecAreaLongitude":-110.150448,"RecAreaLatitude":38.98880143,"lastUpdated":"2020-04-15","address1":"Moab Field Office","address2":"82 East Dogwood","city":"Moab","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1634","RecAreaName":"Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge covers 42,724 acres and lies in the glacial lake country of northwestern Minnesota in Becker County, 18 miles northeast of Detroit Lakes.

Located in the west central portion of Washington County, it is directly southwest of the communities of Ivins and Santa Clara and east of the Shivwits Indian Reservation. The ACEC is incorporated in whole into the Santa Clara River Reserve and is served by two trailheads: Anasazi Valley and Tukupetsi (pronouced tookoo'puts).\nSeveral trails lead visitors to evidence of prehistoric Ancestral Puebloan and Southern Paiute cultures.\n \nThe lower reach of the Santa Clara River has been used and modified by humans for thousands of years. Evidence of different cultures is found throughout the ACEC in the form of habitation sites, special activity areas, and rock art localities. During the Formative Period (ca. 700 B.C. to A.D. 1200) the indigenous people (labeled by archaeologists as Ancestral Puebloans or Virgin Anasazi) became corn and bean farmers who irrigated their crops by diverting water from streams like the Santa Clara River. They constructed permanent village sites and produced fine quality ceramics. Populations living along the Santa Clara River appear to have increased between A.D. 700-1100 (Pueblo I-II), leaving abundant and tangible evidence of their presence on Land Hill, along the riparian corridor, and elsewhere in the area of the ACEC. After A.D. 1200, archaeological sites attributable to the Ancestral Puebloans become increasingly rare, suggesting that changing climatic conditions or other factors forced a change in lifestyle for these early farmers.\n \nDuring the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric Periods (after approximately A.D.1200-1800), the only indigenous people who permanently occupied the region were the Southern Paiute. At springs and along the stream channels, they, too, practiced small-scale farming. Hunting and gathering of native plants were also important in the economic adaptations of the early Southern Paiute. The Shivwits Band of Southern Paiute continue to make the banks of the Santa Clara their homeland.\n \nPermanent agricultural settlements were established by Mormon pioneers along the Santa Clara River during the mid-19th Century. These settlements often displaced the Southern Paiute who had traditionally cultivated the same lands along the river. The early Mormon settlers of southern Utah used the nearby canyons and hills in the area. Several geographic features still bear the names given to them by those early residents: “Big Rock,” “The Gate Rocks,” and Cove Wash.\n","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.7052776,"RecAreaLatitude":37.1577788,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16385","RecAreaName":"Orson B. Adams House","RecAreaDescription":"Orson B. Adams House\n\nThe St. George Field Office has completed rehabilitation of a mid-19th century Mormon pioneer residence for adaptive re-use.  This small sandstone masonry house was built in 1863 for the Orson B. Adams family, in the now abandoned Mormon agricultural settlement of Harrisburg, located approximately 15 miles north of St. George.   Critical to the successful completion of the rehabilitation project were partnerships with Washington County, the Utah Heritage Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation; technical assistance from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office; and volunteer labor during several phases of the project.  The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.  \n\nIn 2004, Washington County, Utah State University (USU), and the Utah Chapter-American Society of Landscape Architects worked with BLM to create a conceptual plan for public recreation use of the 215 acres that surround the Adams house.  Quail Creek flows through the tract, creating a lush riparian area with tall cottonwood trees and willows. Other historic Harrisburg structures, terraced gardens, an orchard, fields outlined by native rock walls, irrigation ditches, and wagon roads are preserved on the property.  Students and faculty from USU documented the features of this still-intact 19th century agrarian landscape, as part of the first Historic American Landscape Survey conducted in Utah.  The final concept plan will integrate the Adams house with a system of linked hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails that connect to trails in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, and the nearby historic Silver Reef mining district.\n\nBased on the conceptual plan, BLM completed an environmental assessment for the proposed development of a non-motorized trail system and an equestrian trailhead. Today the White Reef Trailhead provides access to a trail system that visits 5 public use sites within the Red Cliffs Recreation Area including the Orson B. Adams House.\n","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.399608,"RecAreaLatitude":37.20994857,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16386","RecAreaName":"Red Cliffs Archeological Site","RecAreaDescription":"\r\nThe Red Cliffs Archaeological Site houses the remains of structures from when the Ancestral Puebloans were residing there intermittently from about 500 A.D. to 1200 A.D.

It is common to find habitation from these periods along water sources, in this case Quail Creek, where farming of maize and other crops was possible. One or two families lived together in pithouses, and later in multi-roomed surface pueblos. The families at this site were primarily sedentary farmers, cultivating small fields along the creek, but would also gather native plants and hunt.

Located approximately 12 miles south of St. George, Utah, the historic site is generally accessible year-round, via the unpaved Warner Valley Road.   Other heritage points of interest on public lands are nearby, including the Honeymoon Trail and the interpreted Warner Valley Dinosaur Track Site. \n\nThe small structure at the Fort Pearce Historic Site is one of only three remaining stone guard posts built during Utah’s Black Hawk War.  This “war” was actually period of intermittent raiding between 1865 and 1870, during which the Ute Tribe, led by Chief Black Hawk (Antonga), and other Native Americans allies attempted to drive the Mormons from the Ute traditional homelands.  Mounted Ute raiding parties, often joined by Navajos, stole Mormon livestock, attacked outlying ranches and settlements, and killed settlers who interfered with the raids.  More than 100 Native Americans and at least 70 Mormons were killed during the raiding.  \n\nTo protect their herds and homes, local Mormon militia constructed a series of protected guard or sentry posts, called ‘forts’, along major trails and travel corridors in central and southern Utah.  Four to six armed men with horses were stationed at each post, to attack and delay the Indian raiding parties, while a rider raced to the nearest settlements with a warning.   Horses were stabled at night in the guard posts, to ensure that the early warning ride could be made without delay.\n\nFort Pearce Wash was one of the primary routes along which Ute-Navajo horsemen traveled to raid the livestock herds and settlements of the St. George Basin.  A site was selected in the spring of 1866, on a high bluff overlooking a narrow, steep-sided canyon, just above the only natural spring for miles, for a guard post along Fort Pearce Wash.  A small number of armed men could easily defend this location and water from the spring would support the defenders and their stock.  A work party of 20 men began construction on that guard post on December 4, 1866, working for nearly a month to quarry enough local sandstone to construct the dry-laid or mud-mortared defensive structure and a stock corral; the post and the drainage were named in honor of Major John D.L. Pearce of the Iron County Militia.  \n\nThe dimensions of the roofless guard post were approximately 42 feet north-south by 22 east-west, with 7 to 8 foot high walls and one exterior doorway.  The interior of the structure was divided by a partition wall into two rooms.  Small protruding rectangular abutments were added off the northwest and southeast corners as flanking walls and 10 vertical firing slits or gun ports were constructed near the tops of the walls.   No armed conflicts are known to have taken place at Fort Pearce, but the guard post was manned, at least intermittently, from 1866 until 1873, when peace negotiations and U.S. Army actions ended the raiding that was known in Utah as the Black Hawk War.","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.5831464,"RecAreaLatitude":37.11586722,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1639","RecAreaName":"Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge is a dynamic landscape made up of forests, wetlands, tundra, lakes, mountains and glacial rivers bounded by the snowy peaks of the Alaska Range.

Many of these birds breed and nest on the refuge. Others pass through on their way to breeding and nesting grounds elsewhere in the state. Migrants, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, raptors and songbirds, begin arriving in the valley in April, and continue into early June. An estimated 116 species breed on Tetlin during the short summer, when long days and warm temperatures accelerate the growth of plants, insects and other invertebrates, providing a ready source of rich foods for nesting birds.\n\n\n\nTetlin Refuge also supports a variety of large mammals. Dall sheep dot the higher slopes while moose feed upon the tender new growth that springs up in the wake of frequent lightning caused fires. Wolves, grizzly and black bears and members of three different caribou herds range over the refuge. \n\n\n\nTwo of the six known humpback whitefish spawning areas in the Yukon River drainage are located within the refuge.

Free dispersed camping at Bridger Jack Mesa is limited to designated sites only.  In other areas please limit dispersed camping to previously disturbed sites.<p>  \r\nAlteration of rock surfaces and removal or vegetation is prohibited. Several popular climbs can only be reached by crossing private land. Please use existing trails and respect private land signs and fences. Climbing on petroglyphs is unlawful and destructive. Please Respect and Protect cultural resources.<p>\r\n<strong>See Mountain Project for climbing beta / route information https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105716763/indian-creek </strong><p>Camping: Numerous campgrounds in the vicinity. See georeferenced map.<p>https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/BLMUtahBearsEarsNationalMonumentMap.pdf<p> <strong> KNOW BEFORE YOU GO</strong><p>\r\nSafety Tips / Water<p>\r\nPlease do not climb when the rock is wet. Wet sandstone will erode much faster, widening cracks and leaving rope grooves. More importantly, climbing on wet sandstone weakens anchors and has been linked to cams failing. Protect and conserve scarce desert water sources. Camp at least 300 feet from isolated water sources to allow for wildlife access. Leave gates open or closed as you find them. Beware of rattlesnakes.<p>\r\nWeather Information and Tips<p>\r\nIt is extremely hot in the summer (triple digits) and cold in the winter with snow at higher elevations. The terrain can be sandy or forested, can contain copious amounts of slick rock or clay, and ranges from relatively flat to vertical.<p>\r\nEducational Information / Environmental Protection<p>\r\nAs you are planning your next desert adventure to climb, learn how to take care of this environment and minimize your impact. The desert environment demands some very specific minimum impact behaviors due to its unique and fragile terrain. Take care when traveling to and from the cliffs and boulders not to trample fragile cryptobiotic soil, which is a living crust that plays an important ecological role in many desert environments. Always pack out human waste, as desert soil lacks the necessary microorganisms to biodegrade it. Wait 24-48 hours to climb on sandstone following rain.<p>\r\nHistorical Information / Cultural Resource Protection<p>\r\nLeave historic sites, Native American rock art, ruins and artifacts untouched for the future. Admire rock art from a distance, but never touch it. Stay out of ruins, leave artifacts in place, and report any violations to the BLM Monticello Field Office at (435) 587-1500. Respect and Protect cultural and natural resources.  Learn more about Archaeological Site Etiquette.<p>\r\nScientific Information / Wildlife Safety<p>\r\nWhen encountering wildlife, maintain your distance and remain quiet. Teach children not to pick up, chase, or approach animals. Keep pets under control.<p>\r\nLeave No Trace / Wilderness Ethics<p>\r\nTread lightly when traveling and leave no trace of your camping. Drive and ride only on roads and trails where such travel is allowed. Hike only on established trails, on rock, or in washes. Camp at designated sites, or at previously used sites where dispersed camping is allowed. Avoid placing tents on top of vegetation. Use a camp stove instead of making a campfire. Unless signs indicate otherwise, leave gates open or closed as you find them.\r\n","RecAreaPhone":"435-587-1500","RecAreaEmail":"utmtmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/BLMUtahBearsEarsNationalMonumentMap.pdf","RecAreaLongitude":-109.548096,"RecAreaLatitude":38.037109,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Monticello Field Office","address2":"365 North Main","city":"Monticello","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1642","RecAreaName":"Texas Point National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"Bayous weave through a seemingly endless expanse of cordgrass, reptilian eyes at the water's surface witness the ever-changing variety of waterfowl, and the call of the clapper rail reverberates through the marsh.

In the late 1870s, Mormon colonists had been sent by church leaders to pioneer new settlements along Arizona’s Little Colorado River.  As the new settlements were remote and isolated, many goods and services could only be obtained from the established Mormon communities of southern Utah.   After 1877, the Arizona Mormon settlers also traveled to St. George, Utah to conduct church business and have their marriage vows solemnized in the newly-completed St. George Temple.  So many newlyweds traveled the wagon road that it came to be known as “the Honeymoon Trail”.Couples would travel in small groups for safety and companionship to make this long-distance trek across the varied and rugged terrain of northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah.   This journey typically began in mid-November and required many weeks of hard travel to complete.   The wagons jolted across deep dry washes and slick rock, bogged down in deep sandy soils, and became mired in muddy stream crossings.   At Lee’s Ferry, John D. Lee and his wife Emma provided regular ferry service for travelers, at one of the few feasible crossings of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.   Their journey then took them to Kanab, Utah, south to Pipe Springs, Arizona, finally heading north into Washington County.  Here, the Honeymoon Trail followed Fort Pearce Wash and headed north through the Warner Valley into St. George.  The spring at the historic Fort Pearce site was a popular overnight camping spot for these travelers, some of whom inscribed their names and the dates of their visits on the rocky cliff faces at the spring.   After their marriage ceremonies, the newlyweds would often spend the winter months in St. George, enjoying the social activities of this established community and purchasing needed supplies.  They began the long trip home in the early spring.  The Honeymoon Trail continued in use well into the 20th century, when modern highways were finally constructed across northeastern Arizona.","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.306355,"RecAreaLatitude":37.058373,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16455","RecAreaName":"Old Spanish National Historic Trail","RecAreaDescription":"Old Spanish Trail National Historic Trail, 1829-1848In 2002, Congress designated the Old Spanish Trail (OST) as America's 15th National Historic Trail, to acknowledge the significant role that this long-distance trail network played in the exploration and settlement of the interior Mountain West, southern Nevada, and southern California. </p>The OST is jointly administered by BLM and the National Park Service along its 2,700 mile length, in partnership with other federal, state, tribal, and local government agencies, as well as private land owners, that administer or own lands along the trail.</p>Between 1829 and 1848, commercial traders, explorers, horse thieves, and settlers traveled this difficult pack trail between the Spanish colonies in New Mexico and southern California.

This group left Abiquiu, New Mexico, in November of 1829 with a horse and mule pack train loaded with woven goods to sell in California. They followed a route that took them through the Four Corners area to the Colorado River where the Dominquez-Escalante party had crossed in 1776. From this crossing, the route headed across northeastern Arizona to the Virgin River in Utah. The party then followed the Virgin River to the Colorado River, diverted southwesterly across the Mojave Desert of Nevada, arriving in Santa Barbara, California three months later. Their return trip to New Mexico, driving horses and mules purchased in California, took only 40 days, as they were now traveling a known route. Armijo’s party pioneered a new trail and demonstrated the feasibility of commercial trade between New Mexico and California. In Washington County, the Northern and Armijo Routes cross public lands managed by the St. George Field Office. The Northern Route entered the county near New Castle, traversing the Dixie National Forest to Mountain Meadows. Mountain Meadows was an important resting spot for the traders and their stock, as water and forage were predictably available there. The route then followed the Santa Clara River to Camp Spring, on the Shivwits Indian Reservation, and then left the river to go overland in a southwesterly direction to the Virgin River, near Beaver Dam, Arizona. The exact route of the trail probably varied somewhat by season and the availability of water and feed. Some traders may have followed the Santa Clara River south to its intersection with the Virgin River near St. George, Utah, rather than taking the overland route. Few traces of the OST remain, although the travel corridor and the rugged landscape through which the pack mule trains and New Mexico traders passed can still be experienced and appreciated by modern visitors.The Armijo Route followed Fort Pearce Wash in Washington County, bearing northwesterly to intercept the Virgin River, just west of Hurricane, Utah. The party continued south along the Virgin River to a campsite near Littlefield Arizona, ultimately traveling along the Virgin River to its confluence with the Colorado River, east of Las Vegas, Nevada.","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.409557,"RecAreaLatitude":37.013608,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16457","RecAreaName":"Old Highway 91","RecAreaDescription":"U.S. Highway 91 (“Old Highway 91”) U.S. Highway 91 was the first paved interstate highway to be constructed through southern Utah during the 1920s.

In the late 18th century, when Spanish colonists in New Mexico sought travel routes to the California colonial settlements, they engaged Native Americans to guide them on their westward explorations.   Their Indian guides led them along the well-traveled footpaths that they followed to trade with tribes living along the California coast for shell beads and other products.  Between 1820 and 1850, the stock trail known as the “Old Spanish Trail” between Santa Fe and Los Angeles was regularly traveled by New Mexico traders, fur trappers, and hardy immigrants.  After 1850, Mormon settlers, who had arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, and “49ers” headed to the California gold fields took ox and horse-drawn wagons over this trail and created alternative routes to avoid terrain that could not be negotiated by wagons.  Wagon roads proliferated in the Intermountain West during the latter half of the 19th century, as silver mining districts in this region boomed and new Mormon colonies were established in Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.  By the first decades of the 20th century, “horseless carriages” were replacing horse-drawn wagons and new roads had to be constructed to accommodate this mode of travel.    Several of the widely-known early trails, wagon and automobile roads crossed Washington County.  These include the Dominquez-Escalante Trail, the Old Spanish National Historic Trail, the Mormon Road, the Honeymoon Trail, and the Arrowhead Highway.

Kemple was an experienced prospector, and in 1868 he found a mineralized sandstone float (an ore unattached to the bedrock) that assayed very high in silver, but he had a hard time pinpointing its source. He returned in 1870, and discovered silver in the White Reef, at the Southern base of Pine Valley Mountain. But because the silver was in sandstone, which at the time was considered impossible, assayers were skeptical of his findings, which slowed the process for locating the source of his supplies. In 1874, John Kemple took the lead in organizing a new mining district called the Harrisburg Mining District, and Orson B. Adams was elected president. The first claim recorded within this district, was only about 300 hundred yards southwest from the Orson Adams House and was named Pride of the West Ledge and Kemple Company. Two years later, by early 1876, a surge of silver fever took off, and miners, along with supporting industries, flowed into the area.With the closest railroad a 100 miles away in Milford, on-site transformation of silver ore into bullion was crucial. The nearest mills were more than 300 miles away, so it was decided to build mills near the mines, process the ore, and then ship finished bullion to the railroad by wagon. Three of the five mills were built in Silver Reef, with one in Leeds and the other on the Virgin River, named Stormont Mill. Mines that would not pay before the mills came were now considered valuable property. During 1876, Silver Reef was one of the largest towns in Washington County, with about 1,500 residents. A development boom took place along mile-long Main Street, including the construction of 6 saloons, 9 grocery stores, 2 dance halls, a brewery, a billiard hall, the Wells Fargo Express Office, a jail, and a church, amongst many others. St. John Catholic Church was Southern Utah’s first established Catholic congregation, founded in 1879, which housed the town’s hospital in a rear wing. Only remnants of the church can still be seen. Town advocates wanted Silver Reef to become the county seat, but the more conservative citizens of neighboring towns, established by members of the LDS church, were against it.  As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town went extinct, neighboring town residents burrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.367778,"RecAreaLatitude":37.252778,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1646","RecAreaName":"Toppenish National Wildlife Refuge","RecAreaDescription":"In the agriculturally-intensive Yakima Valley of eastern Washington, there is a wildlife oasis--the Toppenish National Wildlife Refuge.

The concept of such a route was proposed in 1914 by businessmen in Las Vegas, to encourage automobile tourism between Los Angeles, CA and Salt Lake City, UT, through southern Nevada. Their proposed route followed the route of a late 19th century wagon road, the “Old Mormon Road” and the earlier “Old Spanish Trail”.  Touring clubs and local communities in southern California, Nevada, and Utah published maps and promoted tourist travel on “the Arrowhead Trail”.   As few segments of the route were constructed roads, mechanical breakdowns, flat tires, and overheated engines in remote areas challenged even the most adventurous travelers.  In 1918, the first stretches of road in southern Utah were improved by Washington County prison work crews and laborers from St. George and Santa Clara, working with horse teams and “Fresno scrapers”.  The route of the Arrowhead Highway through Beaver Dam Wash NCA closely followed the alignment of the later paved U.S. Highway 91. Artifacts and structures associated with early service stations that supplied water, gasoline, tire repairs and overnight tent camping areas to travelers on the Arrowhead Highway have been documented in the NCA.","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.871138,"RecAreaLatitude":37.075889,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16461","RecAreaName":"Old Mormon Wagon Road","RecAreaDescription":"Wagon travel on the Northern Route of the Old Spanish Trail began in 1847, when the first Mormon settlement in Utah Territory was established east of the Great Salt Lake.   Exploration parties were immediately sent by church leaders to identify locations suitable for colonization along the Old Spanish Trail, to gain political control of the most important travel corridor in the Intermountain West.   In October of 1847, Jefferson Hunt, who had served in the Mormon Battalion in California, led a group of 18 men, 130 pack mules, and a single wagon to southern California to buy cattle, seed grain, and other needed goods.   The party arrived in San Bernardino after 45 days of travel, having reportedly brought the first wagon over the Old Spanish Trail.  The success of this expedition encouraged others to follow, including large numbers of prospectors and merchants “rushing” to the newly-discovered gold deposits at Sutter’s Mill in northern California during the winter months when the passes of the high Sierras would be impassable.  Over time, the wagon road that developed was labeled on maps as the “Old Southern Road”, the “Immigrant Road” or the “Old Mormon Road”.    By the first decade of the 20th century, early automobiles were traveling this same route and paved highways eventually replaced the wagon ruts.","RecAreaPhone":"435-688-3200","RecAreaEmail":"utsgmail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-113.306473,"RecAreaLatitude":37.058297,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"353 East Riverside Drive","address2":"","city":"St. George","state":"UT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16462","RecAreaName":"Range Creek","RecAreaDescription":"Tucked into the Book Cliffs in Carbon and Emery Counties west of Tavaputs Plateau lies the Range Creek Valley.

Topaz Mountain is one of the world's great places to find topaz. If you search the washes and slopes on the south side of the mountain you will find small topaz crystals glimmering in the sunlight. If you search seams in the rhyolite, you may find gem-quality crystals. Topaz Mountain is located in a remote area where there is no water and no services are provided. You should always carry food, plenty of water, tools and emergency equipment. To dig the topaz, helpful tools include a rock hammer or regular hammer, screw driver, bags for your gems, hiking boots, hat, sun screen, bug repellant and once again don t forget the water!

From the lush riparian areas surrounding the Sacramento River and it's tributaries to the expanse of the rolling hills of blue oak savanah, the Sacramento River Bend Area offers diverse habitat for bald eagles, osprey, migratory and song birds, deer, and salmon.  The area also offers numerous recreation opportunities for hunting, camping, hiking, boating, picnicking, and wildlife viewing.<p>\n<h2>Boating Access</h2>The Sacramento River (from Balls Ferry to Red Bluff) is served by a variety of developed boat ramps and primitive river access sites. Public boat ramps are available at Balls Ferry, Bend Bridge Park, and Lake Red Bluff Recreation Area. Jelly's Ferry, Barge Hole, and Perry Riffle (walk in only) offer primitive launch sites. The boat ramp at Reading Island can be used by small watercraft, but is usually overgrown with vegetation during the summer months making it challenging for any watercraft. Please see the Sacramento River Bend Area map for specific locations and directions.<p>\n<h2>Paynes Creek Wetlands</h2>Concerns have increased in recent years over population declines of migratory bird species that breed in North America and winter south of the United States - Neotropical Migratory Birds. The BLM recognizes this problem and has created the Payne's Creek Wetlands with the help of partners like California Fish and Game, Bureau of Reclamation, California Wildlife Conservation Board, and Ducks Unlimited in an effort to enhance populations of these birds and other species. The BLM manages this wetland area, located along the Pacific Flyway, to protect and enhance the existing riparian habitat and wildlife communities, as well as provide for recreational use, cultural and natural interpretation, and educational opportunities.<p>\n<h2>Trails</h2>Most attractions along the river can be reached by foot, mountain bike or horseback. Trailheads begin at Hog Lake Plateau, Iron Canyon, the Paynes Creek Recreation Area (Bass Pond), Jelly's Ferry and multiple trailheads surrounding the Paynes Creek Wetlands. The Paynes Creek Wetlands trail systems and Hog Lake Plateau allow for great springtime wildlife viewing. The Yana Trail, with trailheads at Perry Riffle and Jelly's Ferry, is a great way to explore the backcountry. Most trails are rugged and unmarked and encourage self-discovery. Please remember to close any gates behind you after you pass through.<p>\n<h2>Wildflowers</h2>This area offers amazing wildflowers viewing in the spring. The rolling hills of this oak woodland are carpeted with purple and yellow in all directions. The Hog Lake Plateau and the Yana Trail are great locations to view open expanses of blooming wildflowers.<p>\n<h2>Camping</h2>Although there are no developed BLM campgrounds in this area, camping is allowed on most BLM lands for up to 14 days per calendar year. Day-use sites such as the Jelly's Ferry site, the mouth of Inks Creek, and the Bass Pond parking areas are closed to camping. Group camping is available at the Reading Island Group Campground, under a special use permit issued by the BLM. Massacre Flat is a popular primitive campsite for boaters. The state managed Battle Creek and Cottonwood Creek Wildlife Areas are closed to camping. There is no garbage collection in most of the area so if you PACK IT IN please PACK IT OUT.<p>\n<h2>Hunting</h2>Most BLM lands are open to hunting under California Department of Fish and Game regulations. Some sites such as Reading Island and the state managed Battle Creek Wildlife Area are closed to hunting and shooting. Be courteous to private property owners adjacent to public land. Remember, it is against State law to discharge a weapon within 150 yards of a dwelling or outbuilding. Target shooting is prohibited with the exception of one designated target shooting area along Spring Branch Road. Please remove all shells and debris to keep your public lands clean and safe.<p>\n<h2>Safety Concerns</h2>\n•\tThe Sacramento River water is cold (45°-50°) year-round and is deceptively swift and powerful.<p>\n•\tAlways wear an approved floatation device when on the river.<p>\n•\tThe Yana Trail fords Inks Creek and is impassible at times of wet weather. Contact the BLM Redding Field Office prior to a wet weather hike on the Yana Trail.<p>\n•\tRattlesnakes are a common sight on warm days. Watch your step.<p>\n•\tSummer temperatures in this area can exceed 100°F and there is no potable water available in the area, so bring plenty of drinking water.\n","RecAreaPhone":"530-224-2100","RecAreaEmail":"blm_ca_web_re@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/media-center-public-room-california-sacramento-river-bend-area-guide.pdf","RecAreaLongitude":-122.196902,"RecAreaLatitude":40.272784,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Bureau of Land Management","address2":"Redding Field Office","city":"Redding","state":"CA","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16574","RecAreaName":"Trinity","RecAreaDescription":"<h3>In accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and with the <a href= https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.21.20-EO-N-35-20.pdf>Governor’s shelter in place order</a>, the BLM will temporarily close its developed campgrounds along the Trinity River until further notice to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Prior to establishment of the refuge, it was the site of the Wapanocca Outing Club which was formed in 1886.  This was one of the oldest and most prestigious hunting clubs.  The club managed for waterfowl and most of the lake was set aside as a waterfowl sanctuary.\n\n\n\nToday the refuge literally stands as a wildlife oasis in an agricultural sea.  An excellent diversity of habitat exists comprised on mainly agricultural land, bottomland hardwood forest, early stage reforested hardwoods, open water and flooded cypress/willow swamp.  Thirty small field impoundments totaling 190 acres have been developed for waterfowl in the agricultural area.  Because of its strategic location in the heart of the Mississippi Flyway and the diverse habitat, the refuge is a prime wintering area for migratory waterfowl and a major stopping place for migrating warblers.  Bald eagles, great blue herons, great egrets and anhingas nest on the refuge.\n\n\n\nDue to loss of the major water source for the 600 acre Wapanocca Lake, fisheries has declined from historical levels, but the lake is still a major attraction for waterfowl to this area.","RecAreaPhone":"870-347-2614","RecAreaEmail":"glen_miller@fws.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-90.21669769,"RecAreaLatitude":35.34999847,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"26320 Highway 33 South","address2":"","city":"Augusta","state":"AR","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16631","RecAreaName":"Middle Fork Trail","RecAreaDescription":"Located at mile 169.5 on the west side of the Richardson Highway, this is one of the most highly used trails in the district.

The refuge's saltmarshes, combined with the adjacent New York State-owned saltmarsh, form the largest continuous saltmarsh on Long Island. \n\n\n\nThe remaining half of the refuge is upland featuring the rare Pine Barren habitats of pitch pine, oak-pine, mixed oak, pioneer hardwood, upland shrub, and grasslands.  \n\n\n\nThe refuge's wildlife populations are quite diverse.  About 300 species of birds have been documented at Wertheim. The refuge winters up to 5,000 waterfowl, the majority being black ducks - a species in nationwide decline. The coastal location also makes this refuge an excellent migration corridor for shorebirds, raptors and songbirds. \n\n\n\nThe main purpose for establishing the refuge was to protect the Carmans River Estuary for migratory birds.

Endangered and threatened species such as peregrine falcons, bald eagles, Oregon chub, and Bradshaw's desert parsley find protection and sanctuary on the refuge. A herd of Roosevelt elk can be found in the bottomland forests or farm fields on the refuge. \n\n\n\nOf historic interest is the Fiechter House, completed in 1857, and thought to be the oldest house in Benton County.

The lake itself is a man-made reservoir created when the Cimarron River was impounded by the Eagle Nest Dam in 1918. The Dam's purpose was to store the surplus water of the Cimarron River for irrigation.  Most of the labor for building the dam was provided by the Taos Pueblo Indians. The largest privately constructed dam in the United States, the concrete structure is 400 feet wide, stands 140 feet above the river bed, and is 9.5 feet thick at its crest and 45.2 feet thick at its base.  Supposedly, eagles built nests on the sides of the new dam and that's how it got its name.  The lake became an official State Park on July 3, 2004.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIts main attraction is a 2,400-acre lake which is popular for fishing and boating in the summer, and ice fishing and snowmobiling in the winter. The lake offers excellent fishing. In the winter, anglers wander out onto its frozen surface, drill a hole and try their hand at landing kokanee salmon, rainbow trout and cutthroat trout.  The lake is home to several species of fish, including rainbow trout, brown trout, cutthroat trout, kokanee salmon, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, common carp, white sucker, channel catfish, sunfish, and northern pike, which were accidentally introduced into Eagle Nest Lake (the park recommends anglers to keep the pike, because of their threat to the lake's gamefish populations).<br><br>\r\n\r\nEagle Nest State Park offers a visitor center, camping, allows horseback riding (in designated areas), group shelters, restrooms, boating/boat ramps, fishing, trails, and has R.V.

The river offers one-week float trips notable not only for scenery and remoteness but for convenience -- floaters can access both ends of the Wild River segment from BLM recreation sites along the Steese Highway.</p><p>The Bureau of Land Management manages 110 miles of upper Birch Creek as a wild river under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The river continues through state, private and Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge land for a total of 344 miles before emptying into the Yukon River about halfway between Fort Yukon and Beaver.</p><p>Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River offers outstanding recreation opportunities for float boat use for those experienced with canoe, kayak, or raft. Float trips usually take about 50 hours of actual water time to travel the 110 river miles between BLM's put-in and take-out waysides, both located on the Steese Highway. A leisurely trip requires 7 to 10 days. The water is predominately Class I, but there are some Class II and Class III areas.</p><p>Although visited primarily in summer, Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River offers many winter activities for those wanting a primitive backcountry experience. Snowmobiling along the creek is popular in March and April as the days get longer and temperatures start to rise. For a few days each February, the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between Fairbanks and Whitehorse makes portions of Birch Creek busy with dog teams and mushers. Dog mushing, trapping, and cross-country skiing are popular winter activities along the frozen river.</p><p><h2>Monitoring River Levels</h2>A new stream gauge has been installed on Birch Creek near the put-in at the Upper Birch Creek Wayside at Milepost 94 Steese Highway. Using GOES satellite telemetry, water stage, water temperature, air temperature, cumulative precipitation and water turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals. Current observations are available on the National Weather Service?s Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS) website (https://hads.ncep.noaa.gov/charts/AK.shtml).</p>   <p> To view the data, find station BCTA2 (Birch Creek above Twelvemile Creek) in the list, select a time interval, and press \"Decoded Data\" to view the tables and graphs of observations. For those interested in floating Birch Creek, look at the River Height (HG) data for current river stage conditions.</p> <p>Stage of less than 1.0 feet is very low flow, meaning difficult floating, especially for rafts. Stage of 2 feet is moderate flow --good float conditions. Stage of 3 to 3.5 feet or above is considered high water; be prepared for fast current, floating logs, flooded campsites, and potentially dangerous conditions.</p>","RecAreaPhone":"907-474-2200","RecAreaEmail":"EasternInterior@BLM.gov","RecAreaMapURL":" ","RecAreaLongitude":-145.7261,"RecAreaLatitude":65.3944,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Eastern Interior Field Office ","address2":"222 University Avenue","city":"Fairbanks","state":"AK","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"16826","RecAreaName":"Quartzville Creek Wild and Scenic River","RecAreaDescription":"Tranquility and water both flow in the wild and scenic Quartzville Creek, where one may hike, camp, fish or simply gaze into the mesmerizing, cascading waters.

A typical float trip begins at Minam on the Wallowa River and lasts two to three days, taking out on the Grande Ronde River downstream. <br>\r\nPeak recreational boating season is between April and August, although river trips are possible throughout the year, depending on river conditions. Because the rivers are primarily free-flowing, water levels and river character changes dramatically with the seasons and local weather. Higher, faster river flows typically occur in the spring and early summer, as warmer temperatures and increased rainfall melt high mountain snows. As the season progresses, the river level gradually drops. By August, river flows are typically very low, with shallow water and exposed rocks being common. Low water levels usually remain throughout the fall and winter months. Boaters are strongly advised to obtain up-to-date river conditions and weather forecasts when planning their trip.

Many boaters start their trip on the Wallowa River at Minam, Oregon, a tributary of the Grande Ronde river. Trips launched from here typically last 2 to 3 days, although shorter or longer trips are possible with proper planning. Other river access points include Wildcat (or Powwatka) Bridge, Mud Creek, Troy, and Boggan’s Oasis.<br> <br>\r\nBecause the rivers are free-flowing, water level and river character can change suddenly and dramatically. Typical river levels during the primary floating season range between 2,000 and 10,000 c.f.s. (cubic feet per second). High, fast water conditions usually occur in the spring and early summer as warmer temperatures and rainfall melt mountain snow. Shallow, slower conditions typically occur by mid-July and remain through the fall and winter months, with less water and more exposed rocks being common. Boaters are strongly advised to obtain up-to-date river conditions and weather information when planning their trip. Visitors wishing to avoid crowds are advised to plan their trip to avoid all weekends and holidays between May and July.\r\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\r\n<ul><li> \r\nFree, self-issued river permits are required for all boating on the Grande Ronde & Wallowa rivers\r\n</li><li> \r\nPrimitive, undeveloped river camping is available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Visitors are required to follow low impact, “Leave No Trace” practices to minimize the traces of their stay and help preserve the natural resources. Mandatory fire pan and portable toilet use, as well as packing out all garbage and treading lightly on vegetation, helps keep the river corridor clean and healthy for present and future generations. Heavily impacted areas can often lead to further restrictions, and may need to be temporarily closed until they can recover.\r\n</li><li>\r\nNo amenities or improvements exist in much of the river corridor. Natural and man-made hazards exist, including falling trees, rapids, wildlife, bridge abutments, inclement weather, and rugged terrain. Search and rescue assistance in the canyons is very difficult, dangerous, costly, and time-consuming.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\r\nThe Grande Ronde River corridor provides an exceptional diversity of species affording excellent viewing opportunities for game and nongame species. Major species include waterfowl, herons, shorebirds, raptors, upland birds, perching birds, river otters, mink, black bear, bobcat, turkey, and mountain lion. The is also a highly sensitive wintering area for the bald eagle, bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, and whitetail deer.

The 68,000-acre range is managed for between 78-104 wild burros (Equus asinus asinus). The burros roam freely near the ruins of the historic Nevada mining town of Marietta and the seasonally changing Teels Marsh.\r\n\r\nThe Marietta Wild Burro Range was publicly dedicated in 1991-- the 20th anniversary of passage of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.  Designation as a Wild Burro Range means the area may be managed \"principally\", but not necessarily exclusively, for wild burros. This is a national designation conferred by the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). One reason for this area's designation as a range is the unique opportunity available for public viewing of the herd and its habitat.\r\n\r\nThe range is located south east of Hawthorne, Nevada. The area includes nearly 66,500 acres of public land. Patented mining claims around Teels Marsh and the Marietta mining district account for 1,500 acres of private lands within the area.  Enjoy viewing the burros, but DO NOT attempt to chase or feed them.  Take along a pair of binoculars to see the burros \"UP CLOSE\".\r\nSome of the property in Marietta is private. The residents would appreciate your respect. Leave things as you find them, and take all your own trash with you.                You're Way Out There, So Plan Ahead and Be Safe!  The closest town to Marietta is Mina, Nevada approximately 30 miles to the north on Highway 95.  Unlike the wild burro, you will not have time to adapt to the ever-changing environment. Take food, plenty of drinking water (two gallons per person per day), warm clothes and a hat. Check your vehicle's spare tire and fuel gauge before venturing down the dirt roads.\r\n\r\nLastly, this is an old mining district. Open mine shafts, shaky buildings, unstable rock ruins and rattlesnakes are common. LOOK before you STEP, TOUCH or CAMP.","RecAreaPhone":"775 885 6109","RecAreaEmail":"ccfoweb@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-118.327289,"RecAreaLatitude":38.173468,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Carson City District Office","address2":"5665 Morgan Mill Road","city":"Carson City","state":"NV","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1717","RecAreaName":"Fawn Creek","RecAreaDescription":"A quiet undeveloped setting along the river with a small boat ramp providing access to the confluence of Fawn Creek and Smith River.","RecAreaPhone":"541-756-0100","RecAreaEmail":"BLM_OR_CB_Mail@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-123.83093,"RecAreaLatitude":43.78445,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Coos Bay District","address2":"1300 Airport Lane","city":"North Bend","state":"OR","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1720","RecAreaName":"Mt.

Though the Upper Missouri lacks the stimulating whitewater runs much sought after by thrill seekers it more than makes up for the river runners fix with its mesmerizing glimpse of the American west as it once was.<p/><p>  For the family who plays together, the Upper Missouri caters to boaters of all degrees, from the beginning novice to the expert paddler to the leisurely motor boat aficionado.  Visitors embark into a capacious river corridor that seemingly swallows even the largest groups and are treated to a remoteness not often found in the 21st Century.  Optimum periods for boating are May through September with fishing and hunting use replacing leisure boating during the shoulder seasons.  Compared to other rivers in the Northwest visitation is relatively low with an annual average over the past ten years of about five thousand registered boaters during the boating season.  With 149 miles of river and several public launch points to choose from, trip lengths may vary from one day to ten days or more.  By far the most popular float, taking in the scenic White Cliffs, expends two nights with the takeout on the third day.  In this section, visitors will find developed boat camps with vault toilets, fire rings and superb hiking opportunities, not to mention the hauntingly beautiful, geographic splendor of the region.  For those with a few days to spare, an extension of this trip permits the adventurous sort to take in the even more remote and uniquely appealing, Breaks of the lower river section.  \r\n\t<p/><p>The contact point for any excursion on the Upper Missouri should begin by contacting the Lewistown Field Office or the Fort Benton River Management Station, co-located with the Upper Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center on the north bank of the river in Fort Benton, Montana. <p/><p> The staff at this first rate facility can provide a wealth of information on the Monuments varied recreational opportunities, as well as other significant cultural, and historical sites in the surrounding area.  Visitors not fully equipped to go it alone can enlist the aid of commercial outfitters, many of whom live locally and offer a plethora of services such as canoe rentals, fully guided canoe trips, motorized boat trips and vehicle shuttles.<p/>","RecAreaPhone":"406-622-4000","RecAreaEmail":"MT_Lewistown_FO@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-110.2377386,"RecAreaLatitude":48.03166015,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center","address2":"701 7th Street","city":"Fort Benton","state":"MT","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"1766","RecAreaName":"West Eugene Wetlands","RecAreaDescription":"<h2>Overview:</h2>On the western edge of the City of Eugene, visitors can view wildlife and restored wetlands while they walk trails, play a round of disc golf, or ride the Fern Ridge Bicycle Path through the wetlands. <br><br><b>Tsanchiifin Walk</b> - The 0.5 mile Tsanchiifin Walk trail is named after a local band of Kalapuya Indians who lived in this area.

The river begins at not much more than a trickle at an elevation of about 8,000 feet in the Sawtooth and Whitecloud Mountains of central Idaho. It gathers force as it makes its way northeast and then west, fed by snows from the Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains in the south and the Clearwater and Bitterroot Mountains in the north. <p>\r\n \r\nAbout 150 miles further on its westward course, the Salmon River has carved the second deepest canyon in North America, which effectively splits Idaho in half. The section known as the Lower Salmon River begins at Vinegar Creek, 25 miles above the town of Riggins. At Riggins, the river swings north and then west for 87 miles where it then meets the Snake River. The Salmon and Snake combine to flow into the Columbia River and eventually into the ocean. The drainage area of the Salmon River, which lies entirely within Idaho's borders, encompasses approximately 13,550 square miles. <p>\r\n \r\nThe river and its canyon are truly remarkable in this \"pool and drop\" river where difficult rapids are located in the narrow canyons. The numerous unusual white sand beaches offer camping and serve as a reminder that this river is still free flowing. The 20-mile stretch of the Snake River, from the confluence with the Salmon River to the Heller Bar take-out near the confluence with the Grande Ronde River, contains slower moving water with some rapids and is often characterized by stiff up-canyon winds. <p> \r\n \r\nAlong the Lower Salmon River, the BLM manages the following sites: Hammer Creek, Island Bar, Lucile, Old Lucile, Pine Bar, Shorts Bar, Skookumchuck, Slate Creek and White Bird Gravel Pit. <p> The Lower Salmon River from Vinegar Creek to the confluence with the Snake River features 112 miles of Class II-IV whitewater in one of the deepest canyons in the United States. Much of the 53 miles of the river, from White Bird downstream to the confluence of the Snake and Salmon Rivers, is roadless and accessible only by boat. The Lower Salmon is a suitable river for future Wild and Scenic River designation.\r\n\r\nThe BLM recreation sites with provide access to the Lower Salmon are Island Bar, Lucile, Old Lucile, Shorts Bar, Slate Creek, Skookumchuck, White Bird, Hammer Creek and Pine Bar.

Lake Powell is part of the <A HREF=\"http://www.nps.gov/glca\">Glen Canyon National Recreation Area</a>.The Bureau of Reclamation started construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1956 and Lake Powell started filling on March 13, 1963. In 1980, 17 years after the diversion tunnel gates were closed, Lake Powell filled completely. Today, over 20 million people depend on the waters of Lake Powell to sustain life.The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established in 1972 and is operated by the <A HREF=\"http://www.nps.gov\">National Park Service</a>. Visitors to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area number about 2.4 million annually. The Hole in the Rock, Crossing of the Fathers, and Rainbow Bridge National Monument are all publicly-accessible historic sites steeped in western frontier and environmental history.  However, all are reached on the lake by boat.  The Carl Hayden Visitor Center, named after the late Arizona Senator, contains exhibits that focus on the history of the dam and Glen Canyon. With its hundreds of miles of shoreline, Lake Powell affords opportunities for hiking, camping, swimming, boating, and fishing. Although all types of water sports are popular, boating and fishing are the prime attractions. Lake Powell, which offers some of the nation's finest fishing, contains bass, bluegill, green sunfish, walleye, black crappie, northern pike, and catfish. In the river below the dam, the clear, cold waters released from the depths of Lake Powell create a perfect habitat for trout. The blue-ribbon fishery, which was developed after the dam was built, supports trophy-sized trout in the 15-mile reach of river to Lees Ferry.  <A HREF=\"https://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/basin/index.html\"> Current reservoir levels.</a>","RecAreaPhone":"928-608-6404","RecAreaEmail":"lakepleasant@mail.maricopa.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/crsp.html","RecAreaLongitude":-111.49493,"RecAreaLatitude":36.93997,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"Glen Canyon National Recreation Area","address2":"","city":"Page","state":"AZ","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"2005","RecAreaName":"Dakota Prairie National Grasslands","RecAreaDescription":"<h3>Some tips to help you enjoy your recreation experience...</h3>\r\r<ul>\r\t<li><strong>Fireworks</strong> are not allowed on the Grasslands.</li>\r\t<li>Winter brings snow and extreme temperatures.

You cannot always depend on a signpost or a ranger to get you out of a fix. Bring appropriate equipment so you can be prepared for weather changes and can take care of yourself, if necessary, overnight.</p><ul><li><strong>Do not recreate alone</strong>. Or leave an activity plan with friends, family, or a ranger that detail where you will be and when you expect to return.</li><li><strong>Have a communication plan</strong>. Cellphones do not get signal in all parts on the National Monument; a radio, personal locator beacon, satellite phone, or signaling mirror can be crucial in a time of need.</li><li><strong>Carry and drink as much water as you can</strong>. At least one gallon per person per day is recommended. When half of your water is gone, turn around and head back.</li><li><strong>Protect yourself from the sun</strong>. Dress in layers, Wear a hat, sunglasses, protective clothing, and sturdy footwear. Use sunscreen. Bring warm layers and a waterproof shell on longer hikes – the weather can change quickly.</li><li><strong>Know your trail</strong>. Carry a map and pay attention to the terrain so you can find your way back.</li><li><strong>Beware of dangerous flora and fauna</strong>. Watch where you put your hands and feet. Cacti, ocotillo, rattlesnakes, and bees (to name a few) may pose danger to visitors.</li><li><strong>Keep children near you and stay on the trail</strong>.</li></ul><p><h2>Recreation</h2> </p>To help you decide which of the many trails to take – especially if you’re a newcomer – we have divided the National Monument into three areas: the<a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-SanJac.pdf\"> San Jacinto Mountains</a> west of Palm Canyon divide, the <a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-NSR.pdf\">Northern Santa Rosa Mountains </a>between the Palm Canyon divide and Highway 74, and the <a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-SSR.pdf\">Southern Santa Rosa Mountains </a>from Highway 74 to the Monument’s border with Anza Borrego Desert State Park. Each area has its own personality. Along with the trail areas listed above, these are some of the more <a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-Other.pdf\">popular trails </a>in the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument.</p><p>Trails are rated as easy, moderate, or strenuous in accordance with the following criteria*:</p><ul><li><strong>Easy</strong> – Generally a leisurely walk, but don’t expect the trail to be flat.</li><li><strong>Moderate</strong> – A serious hike, but not difficult for those in reasonably good condition.</li><li><strong>Strenuous</strong> – Some trail segments require being in very good condition and/or the trail is long and requires stamina.</li></ul><p>*Difficulty ratings are based on one-way trips. When assessing how difficult a trail may be for you, consider whether you plan to return on the same trail, thereby doubling your distance, or by using another trail which also adds mileage and difficulty. Be aware that using two moderate trails to complete a loop may result in a strenuous hike.</p><p>The best time of year for enjoying lower elevation trails is November through April; for higher elevation trails, the best time is May through October.</p><p>Many trails are open to all forms of non-motorized travel – hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking – but not all trails are open to everyone. Mountain bikers are prohibited in designated wilderness areas, in the Indian Canyons, on certain trails near Murray Hill, or on any part of the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5353107.html\">Pacific Crest Trail</a>.

At lower elevations, this prohibition is enforced for the protection of endangered Peninsular bighorn sheep, which react to dogs as they would to coyotes, a natural predator. In the San Jacinto Mountains, which are usually accessed via the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway or from the alpine community of Idyllwild, dogs are prohibited in Mount San Jacinto State Park and Wilderness. Dogs are also prohibited in the Indian Canyons.</p><p><strong>Dog Friendly Areas:</strong></p><p>One of the limited opportunities for taking your dog on mountain trails in the Monument is available on the loop connecting Homme Adams and Cahuilla Hills Parks in the City of Palm Desert. From Homme Adams Park, follow the Homestead Trail to the Hopalong Cassidy Trail, then south on the “Hoppy” to the cross or north to the Gabby Hayes which will take you down to Cahuilla Hills Park, or viceversa. Be aware, however, that dogs are prohibited on segments of the Hopalong Cassidy Trail that extend south of the cross and north of the Gabby Hayes Trail. At higher elevations, dogs are allowed on Forest Service trails, though be sure not to continue with your dog into Mount San Jacinto State Park and Wilderness or the Indian Canyons.</p><p><br />For details about where dogs are allowed and where they are prohibited, please contact the National Monument Visitor Center at <strong>(760) 862-9984</strong>.</p>","RecAreaPhone":"760-862-9984 (Visitor Center) or 760-833-7100 (Field Office)","RecAreaEmail":"BLM_CA_Web_PS@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"","RecAreaLongitude":-116.40793,"RecAreaLatitude":33.6715,"lastUpdated":"2020-05-05","address1":"Bureau of Land Management","address2":"Palm Springs South Coast Field Office","city":"Palm Springs","state":"CA","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"3115","RecAreaName":"Craters of the Moon National Monument","RecAreaDescription":"Established in 1924, Craters of the Moon National Monument celebrated its 75th birthday in 1999.

These lands hold a spectacular array of plant life, wildlife, unique geological features, endless recreational opportunities, and significant historical and cultural values. The rugged landscape has retained much of its unspoiled character over the centuries and, as a result, offers outstanding opportunities for solitude and dispersed recreation. In some areas, the BLM lands are intermingled with State of Montana lands and private property. The monument designation applies only to the BLM-managed lands.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>The land and the rugged, surrounding uplands (commonly call the Missouri Breaks) are defined in part by their history. The entire region was the homeland and lifeblood of American Indians. The river served as the pathway for Lewis and Clark, then the waterway for steamboats and an attraction for fur trappers and traders. Later, the river and the Missouri Breaks were sanctuaries for desperados trying to stay a step ahead of the law. The land was also a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the public lands in the monument make a significant contribution to the local lifestyle and the regional economy. Within the monument, you can float the river, fish, hike, hunt, drive for pleasure, find a little solitude, enjoy a sense of exploration, or simply marvel at the variety of resources around you.

Totaling more than 360 river miles, it may be the longest road-to-road float in North America. </p>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek runs through a remote area of interior Alaska. Most floaters begin in the Nome Creek valley, near the Ophir Creek Campground.  If launching here, take note:  boat motors are limited to 15 horsepower or less. Once you put in at Nome Creek, there are no roads or services until you reach the bridge on the Dalton Highway. It usually takes six days to reach the mouth of Victoria Creek at river mile 111. Many floaters pre-arrange for a Fairbanks air-taxi service to pick them up from a gravel bar a few miles past Victoria Creek. If you continue down Beaver Creek and the Yukon River to the Dalton Highway bridge, you should plan for up to two additional weeks of travel.</p>\r\n<p>Many gravel bars along the river provide great camping. Also the Borealis-LeFevre Cabin at river mile 32 is also available by reservation (check the link below for more information about cabin rentals). Use dead and down wood for campfires and pack out any trash. The BLM supports Leave No Trace camping techniques., so please remove any trace of your camp, such as fire rings, and scatter any firewood piles.</p>\r\n<p>Wind, rain, and freezing temperatures have weathered away the surrounding rock to expose the jagged cliffs and peaks seen along Beaver Creek. These high ridges are home to Dall sheep and peregrine falcons. Along the creeks, the gravel soils support tall white spruce trees and dense brush that line the banks. Eagles, peregrine falcon, and owls hunt the river corridor. Migratory waterfowl, such as mergansers, shovelheads, goldeneyes, and harlequins spend the summers along Beaver Creek. Known for its large dorsal fin, the Arctic grayling is the predominant fish species in the White Mountains. Other types of fish include northern pike, sheefish, burbot, and salmon. </p>\r\n<h2>Monitoring River Levels</h2><p>A stream gauge on Nome Creek near by Ophir Creek Campground provides useful information for monitoring Beaver Creek floating conditions. Using GOES satellite telemetry, water stage, water temperature, air temperature, and cumulative precipitation are recorded at 15-minute intervals. Current observations are available on the National Weather Service’s Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS) website (https://hads.ncep.noaa.gov/charts/AK.shtml).</p> <p>To view the data, find station NOCA2 (Nome Creek above Beaver Creek) in the list, select a time interval, and press “Decoded Data” to view the tables and graphs of observations.</p> <p> For those interested in floating Beaver Creek, look at the River Height (HG) data for current river stage conditions.  Stage of less than 2 feet is very low flow, meaning difficult floating, especially for rafts. Stage of 2.5 feet is moderate flow -- good float conditions. Stage of 2.75 to 3 feet or above is considered high water; be prepared for fast current, floating logs, flooded campsites, and potentially dangerous conditions.</p><br/> \r\n<h2>Winter Activities</h2><p> Beaver Creek Wild and Scenic River also offers many winter activities for those wanting a primitive backcountry experience.

However, travelers will likely encounter local fishermen and other local travelers in power boats along the lower reaches of the river.\r\n\r\nKALTAG PORTAGE\r\nThe Unalakleet River is located within the Kaltag Portage, which has been an important route for travel, transportation, and trade between Norton Sound and Interior Alaska for thousands of years.  It served as a vital link between the Iсupiat and Yup’ik of the coast, and the Yukon River and Athabascan groups in the Interior.  During the period of Alaskan development, the Kaltag Portage was used as a route for both the historic Iditarod Trail and the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS).\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\nThe name Unalakleet is an Iсupiaq word meaning “place where the east wind blows.”  Summer temperatures average from 40° to 60°F.  Rain is common throughout the summer and varies between a light mist and a heavy downpour.  Weather conditions can change quickly and summer storms can cause water levels to rise rapidly, creating potential flooding hazards.\r\n\r\nCAMPING\r\nThere are no established campsites or public facilities along the river corridor.  The Unalakleet National Wild River corridor ends at its confluence with the Chirosky River, 24 river miles upstream from the village of Unalakleet.  In the wild river corridor and below the Chirosky River, there are individual Native allotments which are private.  Contact the Unalakleet Native Corporation for permission to camp on Alaska Native lands below the Chirosky River.\r\n\r\nFISHING\r\nFishing is excellent for Coho, Chum, and Pink salmon.  Arctic grayling and Dolly Varden are also plentiful.\r\n\r\nSUMMER RECREATION\r\nThe Unalakleet River supports such activities as fishing, boating, and camping. The best time to visit is July through mid-September to take full advantage of the midnight sunshine and discover what is considered to be one of the greatest salmon runs in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWINTER RECREATION\r\nThe frozen Unalakleet River comes alive in winter with the joyful cries of sled dogs as the historic Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race parallels the frozen river en route to the finish line in Nome. Popular winter activities along the river corridor include snowmobiling, dog mushing, ice fishing, hunting and trapping.\r\n\r\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\r\nThe upper 81 river miles of the Unalakleet are designated a National Wild River and administered by the Bureau of Land Management. A \"wild river\" is free of impoundments, generally inaccessible except by trail, with primitive watersheds and shorelines, and has unpolluted waters. The BLM manages the Unalakleet National Wild River to provide high-quality primitive recreation opportunities, protect water quality, protect historic and archaeological values, and preserve the remarkable fisheries resources for which the river was designated.\r\n","RecAreaPhone":"907-267-1246","RecAreaEmail":"blm_ak_afo_general_delivery@blm.gov","RecAreaMapURL":"https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/Maps_GeoPDF_Unalakleet_National_Wild_River_20170323.pdf","RecAreaLongitude":-160.79688,"RecAreaLatitude":63.87892,"lastUpdated":"2020-03-20","address1":"4700 BLM Road ","address2":" ","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","media":[]},{"RecAreaID":"587","RecAreaName":"Virgin River Canyon Recreation Management Area","RecAreaDescription":"<p><b>***** Notice of Temporary Closure *****</b><p>The BLM Arizona Strip Field Office has temporarily closed the Virgin River Canyon Recreation Area in order to complete necessary renovations of the restrooms and other infrastructure to ensure the health and safety of visitors. <p>Once renovations are complete, the BLM will notify the public of the reopening of the recreation area through this website and notice to media outlets.

The primary purpose for the designation is to protect and enhance the desert riparian ecosystem, a rare remnant of what was once an extensive network of similar riparian systems throughout the Southwest. <br/><br/> Many recreational opportunities are available within the NCA.  Three of the most popular sites are :  <br/><br/>\t <strong>Murray Springs Clovis Site,</strong>  a significant archaeological site that contains an undisturbed stratigraphic record of the past 40,000 years. Excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona  from 1966 to 1971. People first arrived in this area 11,000 years ago. They belonged to what  we now call the Clovis Culture and were the earliest known people to have inhabited North America. Named after the distinctive and beautifully crafted Clovis spear points they made, they were expert hunters of the large mammals of the last Ice Age. An interpretive trail leads visitors through the site. From Sierra Vista, take Arizona Route 90 east 6 miles to Monson Road. Turn left, and go about 1.2 miles to the signed turnoff to Murray Springs. The access road is located on the right.  \t<br/><br/> <strong>The Spanish Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate</strong> is the most intact remaining example of a once-extensive network of similar presidios. These fortresses marked the northern extension of New Spain into the New World. Only a stone foundation and a few remaining adobe wall remnants mark the location of an isolated and dangerous military station.  From Fairbank on Arizona Route 82, drive approximately 2 miles west on Route 82, turn right on the Kellar Ranch Road and travel approximately 3 miles to the trailhead.   Hike about 2 miles to the ruins and interpretive displays. \t<br/><br/><strong>The San Pedro House</strong>, located 9 miles east of Sierra Vista on Arizona Route 90, is a popular trailhead for birdwatchers, hikers, and mountain bikers.

It is well known for excellent whitewater boating, wildflower viewing, camping, swimming, and recreational gold panning/prospecting. \r\n<p>Visitors will have plenty to do in the Merced River RMA during every season.  Springtime comes early to the Merced River Canyon and by March the wildflower season is well on its way lasting into May.  Easy access, un-damned flows, and excellent whitewater boating attract rafters and kayakers during the spring runoff (April through July).  Commercial rafting trips are available from BLM permitted outfitters. \r\n<p>The Merced River is a very popular swimming destination during the hot California foothill summers with some of the clearest swimming hole around.  Gold panning and prospecting have never fallen out of favor since the 1850’s when this canyon had a large mining population.  In autumn the crowds subside and the Merced River Recreation Area provides more solitude while still offering most of the appeal and activities as earlier in the year.  By winter, true solitude can be found.  The weather is usually quite warm and sunny between storms.  Daytime highs in the 60’s and overnight lows in the 30’s are common.\r\n<p>While some activities are best in specific seasons, there are many things to do all year long.  Bird watching is good throughout the area most of the year.  Fishing is popular for trout and bass along the entire river.  Biking along the gravel roads and trails is popular with families and experienced mountain bikers alike.  Hiking is great anytime of the year.<p>The Merced River Trail continues on downstream from the end of the Briceburg River Road and brings hikers or bikers to the North Fork of the Merced and beyond.  The Burma Grade is another popular route to explore on foot, bike, or high-clearance automobile.  This scenic backroad climbs steeply out of the Merced Canyon and eventually leads to Greely Hill or Buck Meadows (Highway 120).\r\n<p><h2>Special Guidelines for Merced River Recreation Area Campgrounds During COVID-19</h2><p>\r\nIn order to comply with the <a href=https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds.pdf> Mariposa County Interim Guidelines for Campgrounds</a>, the following procedures are put in place: <p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Be prepared</strong> by bringing your own personal hygiene supplies, including <strong>soap, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer.</strong></li>\r\n<li>Only<strong> one household per camp site </strong>(Maximum 8 persons).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Only registered campers in developed campgrounds.</strong> McCabe Beach is for registered campers only during COVID-19 restrictions. <em>(First come first served, on-site registration/payment only—no advanced registration).</li></em>\r\n<li><strong>No group campsites.</strong>  Site #13 will only allow 8 persons.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Stay home</strong> if you are sick.</li></ul><p>\r\n\r\nPlease help keep these campgrounds open by adhering to these guidelines.

Some common species include mourning dove, acorn woodpecker, ash-throated flycatcher, scrub jay, wrentit, plain titmouse, bushtit, Bewick's wren, and house finch. Valley quail and mourning doves are the major game birds in the Red Hills. An abundant insect population supports insectivorous birds including western kingbirds, ash- throated flycatcher, tree swallows, barn swallows, black phoebes, and others.
